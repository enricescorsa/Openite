7,1,"                           Praise for the Book"
7,2,"“The debate around universal basic income (UBI) in India has catalyzed a rethink about"
7,3,"social protection, poverty reduction, and the role of the state in development. These"
7,4,"are issues that go beyond just simple economics. Sociologists, political scientists, and"
7,5,"philosophers have weighed in, each bringing a different and often provocative perspec-"
7,6,"tive about the role of UBI in social contracts that bind our societies. Gentilini et al. offer"
7,7,"a unifying platform from which this diverse spectrum of views can be discussed and"
7,8,"debated in an informed and intelligent way. That it can bring together people from such"
7,9,"diverse backgrounds on a highly divisive topic is a credit to the authors. Their frame-"
7,10,"work, analysis, and empirical rigor will serve as a wonderful guide for policy makers"
7,11,"and practitioners grappling with questions on how to build a modern and state-of-the-art"
7,12,"social protection system. Scholars and policy makers in India and elsewhere have been"
7,13,"waiting for such an analysis.”"
7,14,"                           Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director, India, World Bank Group"
7,15,"“Discussion of a universal basic income (UBI) can be clouded by theology, with any-"
7,16,"thing other than a ‘pure’ UBI cast into outer darkness. The most welcome feature of"
7,17,"this wide-ranging volume is its treatment of the design problem as multidimensional,"
7,18,"recognizing that objectives differ, and so do constraints, notably concerning fiscal, insti-"
7,19,"tutional, and political capacity. While addressing these multiple aspects, the book also"
7,20,"includes empirical analysis of UBI compared with other designs and discussion of the"
7,21,"operational tasks necessary for successful delivery.”"
7,22,"                 Nicholas Barr, Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics"
7,23,"“Public discourse on the potential role for a universal basic income (UBI) in addressing var-"
7,24,"ious socioeconomic challenges has soared over the last decade. However, the discussion"
7,25,"has often been plagued by lack of clarity on what is meant by a UBI and the challenges"
7,26,"it is intended to address. This impressive book provides a transparent and comprehen-"
7,27,"sive framework to inform the debate. It sets out the defining features of a UBI, the various"
7,28,"socioeconomic issues it may help address, and the pros and cons of a UBI in various eco-"
7,29,"nomic and political settings. It makes clear that the attraction of a UBI, or some partial"
7,30,"variant, will depend on country-specific social, economic, and political preferences, as"
7,31,"well as the underlying administrative and fiscal contexts. The detailed empirical analysis"
7,32,"helps to bring these issues out into the light for much-needed scrutiny. It also helps to hit"
7,33,"home the too-often neglected importance of considering both the tax and transfer sides of"
7,34,"the debate to avoid drawing misleading policy conclusions. The passionate debate will no"
7,35,"doubt continue, but this book increases the likelihood that it will now be complemented"
7,36,"by a healthy dose of reason.”"
7,37,"      David Coady, Division Chief, Expenditure Policy Division, International Monetary Fund"
7,38,"“The idea of universal basic income—giving cash unconditionally to everyone—has been"
7,39,"hotly debated, mainly in developed countries. This book sheds much-needed light on"
7,40,"that debate by providing the first dispassionate analysis of UBI in developing countries."
7,41,"All of the issues—poverty impact, fiscal sustainability, labor market outcomes, political"
7,42,
8,1,"economy—are elucidated with evidence. Policy makers may adopt or reject UBI, but"
8,2,"after reading this book, they will do so with clear-eyed reasoning.”"
8,3,"      Shantayanan Devarajan, Professor of Practice of Development, Georgetown University"
8,4,"“Universal basic income has been gaining traction as a potential solution to poverty"
8,5,"and technological unemployment. This book is the ultimate guide for anyone inter-"
8,6,"ested in universal basic income at the global level. The authors leave no stone unturned,"
8,7,"examining the economics and politics of universal basic income, as well as policy imple-"
8,8,"mentation issues across the world.”"
8,9,"             Ioana Marinescu, Assistant Professor of Economics, University of Pennsylvania"
8,10,"“Today’s UBI debates are powerful because of the deep questions they raise—what is the"
8,11,"nature of the social contract? What can and cannot a state with limited capacity realisti-"
8,12,"cally do? This book provides a helpful framework for navigating the issues and grounding"
8,13,"the debate in data. It should be a standard reference.”"

8,16,"“This is the first time the World Bank has taken up the case for a basic income in a con-"
8,17,"structive manner, and should be welcomed by advocates and critics alike. As someone"
8,18,"who has advocated moving in that direction for many years and been involved in pilots"
8,19,"in several countries, I firmly believe it will be an anchor of 21st century income distri-"
8,20,"bution. It is not a panacea, but giving people basic economic security is something that"
8,21,"should unite us all.”"

8,24,"“Universal basic income (UBI) is one of those potentially transformational ideas in both"
8,25,"developing and advanced countries, although for very different reasons. This terrific and"
8,26,"timely volume is a comprehensive guide to the conceptual and implementation issues"
8,27,"relating to UBI. A must-read.”"

8,30,"“Universal basic income (UBI) is far more than a thought experiment—it’s a policy idea"
8,31,"worthy of the in-depth consideration provided in this book. At UNICEF, we examine"
8,32,"and share evidence regarding the potential and design considerations of universal child"
8,33,"benefits: these can be seen as a subset of UBI and, therefore, help contribute to our"
8,34,"common understanding of such interventions. We’re pleased to see these themes dis-"
8,35,"cussed and hope the many other lessons this book provides also help to shape thinking"
8,36,"about strengthened forms of social protection for children and young people.”"

15,2,"A"
15,3,"          t the time of writing this preface, electoral debates in India, which featured uni-"
15,4,"          versal basic income (UBI) in a prominent way, just subsided; pilot programs are"
15,5,"          rolled out in several cities in the United States and Europe; a decade-long trial"
15,6,"          is under way in rural Kenya; and the World Bank is, through this very volume,"
15,7,"issuing its first analysis on the matter. So why all this interest on a seemingly utopian and"
15,8,"radical proposal of “just give cash to everyone”?"
15,9,"       Interest in UBI is surely symptomatic of larger societal discomforts. The chang-"
15,10,"ing nature of work in higher-income countries demands that social protection systems"
15,11,"co-evolve with it. While automation, globalization, and diversification of employment"
15,12,"bolstered efficiency and productivity gains, median income and living standards have"
15,13,"not always risen accordingly—and in some cases, they have been stagnant for decades."
15,14,"Lower-income contexts, where work arrangements have not changed as dramatically,"
15,15,"face different challenges. Among them, pervasive poverty and informality, compounded"
15,16,"with limited government capacities and revenues, are preventing hundreds of millions"
15,17,"of people from accessing higher-productivity activities, being protected from risks, and"
15,18,"building human capital."
15,19,"       With societal anxieties brewing, there are new opportunities for rethinking how to"
15,20,"forge a more inclusive social contract, including with universal social protection at the"
15,21,"core, and do so in ways that leapfrog past models. While new technologies are expand-"
15,22,"ing the delivery frontier, the notion of “universal” social protection is subject to different"
15,23,"interpretations. Specifically, universality can be attained in different ways—for example,"
15,24,"by combining assistance and insurance programs, by combining different safety net"
15,25,"measures, or, as in the case of UBI, achieving such goals via a single measure. Put differ-"
15,26,"ently, a UBI is a shortcut to universality."
15,27,"       On closer scrutiny, however, such a shortcut is less straightforward than it seems."
15,28,"A UBI looks alluringly simple on the surface, since it provides cash unconditionally and"
15,29,"with no targeting involved. But its implications are complex and largely unknown. In"
15,30,"fact, the scale of UBI makes it a systemwide intervention, not just a program. As such, it"
15,31,"may affect, for instance, several labor market issues such as unemployment insurance,"
15,32,"severance pay, unionization, contributory pensions, and minimum wages. With no UBI"
15,33,"                                               xiii"

16,2,"program of national scale currently in place, most debates are shaped by informed views"
16,3,"and inference from smaller-scale schemes rather than from hard evidence and actual"
16,4,"practices. We should be humble about what we know and what we do not on UBI."
16,5,"      A UBI is also less radical than it appears. Depending on how it is financed, the"
16,6,"program could end up distributing differentiated amounts of cash to different people—"
16,7,"and some may not receive any transfer at all (the “net payers”). In other words, the"
16,8,"net effects of benefits and financing could make a UBI a targeted program via taxes (in"
16,9,"addition to participation based on residency and age). Precisely because a UBI may be"
16,10,"de facto targeted, there is a need to clarify how it differs from or complements other"
16,11,"social assistance instruments targeted by income (e.g., guaranteed minimum income"
16,12,"programs), categorical parameters such as age (like social pensions), or other eligibility"
16,13,"criteria. What specific problem is UBI ultimately trying to solve? How does it perform rel-"
16,14,"ative to existing systems? Under what circumstances is the program more or less likely"
16,15,"to be cost-effective?"
16,16,"      It is precisely this set of quandaries—on why, whether, where, and how to consider"
16,17,"UBI—that animated the conception and production of this book. The volume should"
16,18,"not be interpreted as a statement for or against UBI in the abstract. Instead, it engages"
16,19,"in the more laborious, nuanced effort of providing an organizing framework—a struc-"
16,20,"tured thought process—to gauge the many issues that surround the appropriateness and"
16,21,"feasibility of UBI. The framework, which integrates choices around objectives, design,"
16,22,"implementation, performance, political economy, and financing matters into a coherent"
16,23,"device, can help guide and inform decisions in different contexts—on UBI, as well on"
16,24,"virtually any social assistance program."
16,25,"      Ultimately, deliberations on UBI should be based on robust and balanced thought"
16,26,"processes, and this book is poised to inject a much-needed dose of analytics into a"
16,27,"debate too often prone to ideology."

25,4,"U"
25,5,"           niversal basic income (UBI) is a hotly debated idea. In fact, few development"
25,6,"           topics elicit as much interest and controversy as UBI. There is literally a book"
25,7,"           published on the subject every month, with the concept being examined across"
25,8,"           the economics, sociology, governance, philosophical, and political science litera-"
25,9,"ture. It is prompting both curiosity and visceral reactions from policy makers in high- and"
25,10,"lower-income countries alike, including playing a role in political discourse and elec-"
25,11,"tions (Banerjee, Niehaus, and Suri 2019; Hoynes and Rothstein 2019). And the growing"
25,12,"number of experiences and pilots, with variants dating back to the 1970s, is moving UBI"
25,13,"“from a thought experiment to a concrete policy option” (Calnitsky 2017)."
25,14,"       A UBI holds an attractive promise of change across many lines. These include cov-"
25,15,"erage potential, fairness in social contracts, power relations in labor markets, and gender"
25,16,"equity, among others. It may speak, for some, to the appetite for social justice generated"
25,17,"by glaring and growing inequalities in societies (Stern 2016). From this standpoint, a UBI"
25,18,"engenders interest as a societal ideal to which to aspire, and not merely a program (Lowrey"
25,19,"2018). For others, a UBI is poised to mitigate the effects of purported massive job losses"
25,20,"from automation, streamline the chaotic plethora of state-provided schemes, or empower"
25,21,"people by redirecting natural resource–related revenues from public coffers to citizens"
25,22,"(Devarajan 2018; Yang 2018). Overall progress in social protection systems deserves global"
25,23,"celebration, but in many cases, the degree of frustration with those systems is palpable. In"
25,24,"a world riddled with fears about artificial intelligence, exhaustion over complex bureaucra-"
25,25,"cies, and resentment toward politics, the transparency and simplicity of a UBI is alluring."
25,26,"       These diverse rationales explain why a UBI resonates among different audiences."
25,27,"UBI enlists advocates from those embracing a minimalist role of the state to human"

26,2,"rights activists. Some look at a UBI as a foundation to build stronger states; others see"
26,3,"it as a milestone toward rolling back public action and its interference with private lib-"
26,4,"erties—that is, a UBI could embody the “Trojan horse” evoked by Milton Friedman in"
26,5,"the late 1960s and Jean Drèze nowadays (see, e.g., Drèze 2017; Friedman 1967). The"
26,6,"fact that a UBI generates support from some political conservatives, libertarians, and"
26,7,"progressives alike—and from parts of the tech industry and select trade unions—is a"
26,8,"remarkable feature. Such a heterogeneous coalition may help advance the idea, but its"
26,9,"practical implementation would expose the lack of coherent expectations and objectives."
26,10,"For instance, hopes around a UBI as a societal revolution may be tempered by prosaic"
26,11,"forces. After all, the ultimate generators of inequities may lie elsewhere, for example, in"
26,12,"uneven access to education and health systems, low-paying and low-productivity jobs,"
26,13,"poorly functioning markets, corruption, regressive tax codes, unequal pay, and social"
26,14,"discrimination, among others (Piketty 2016). From this perspective, a UBI by itself could"
26,15,"help, but the hopes bestowed on the concept seem excessive."
26,16,"       The prominence of ideological forces and different expectations suggests the need"
26,17,"for a balanced and evidence-based approach (Francese and Prady 2018; Hanna and"
26,18,"Olken 2018). This volume does not aim to provide strict prescriptions for or against a"
26,19,"UBI, but instead a framework within which to think about it. We aim to provide a com-"
26,20,"pass to help navigate key issues, elucidate trade-offs, and offer new data and analysis"
26,21,"to better inform choices around the appropriateness and feasibility of a UBI in differ-"
26,22,"ent contexts. Unlike the bulk of UBI literature, which is skewed toward high-income"
26,23,"societies, we examine the program primarily in the context of low- and middle-income"
26,24,"countries. We intend to provide policy makers and practitioners with a realistic sense"
26,25,"of the entire gamut of policy considerations; offer new quantitative insights around key"
26,26,"choices and implications; and frame the issues within a coherent, objective, and compre-"
26,27,"hensive volume concisely capturing global knowledge on the topic. By doing so, we shed"
26,28,"light on the possible contexts where a UBI may be more or less viable based on a range"
26,29,"of considerations. The overall analysis is conducted within a genuine spirit of curiosity,"
26,30,"combined with a dose of empirical inquiry and a clear-eyed view of the progress and"
26,31,"challenges in the current state of practice. Our multidisciplinary assessment shows that"
26,32,"a UBI presents advantages and limitations just like any other social assistance program."
26,33,"After all, it could be considered a variant on existing age-based categorical schemes. Yet"
26,34,"the scale and likely systemwide effects of a UBI program are exceptional and, as such,"
26,35,"put a high premium on analytical and operational due diligence."
26,36,"       Currently, no country has a UBI in place, although there have been (and still are)"
26,37,"several small-scale pilots and a few larger-scale experiences. Only two countries—Mon-"
26,38,"golia and the Islamic Republic of Iran—had a national UBI in place for a short period"
26,39,"of time. Subnational experiences, such as in Alaska, are providing valuable insights, but"
26,40,"these are constrained in one or more features (e.g., frequency and adequacy of trans-"
26,41,"fers). The large majority of UBI pilots are variants of targeted schemes. For example,"
26,42,"the proposal by Felman et al. (2019) on a “quasi-universal basic rural income” for India"
26,43,"is simply a variant of a traditional guaranteed minimum income program. Quasi-UBI"
26,44,"programs constitute the vast majority of so-called UBI pilots laid out in chapter 1. The"

27,2," reframing of different programs in UBI or quasi-UBI terms is unhelpful because (1) this"
27,3," confuses and polarizes the current debate by trading accuracy for public resonance; (2)"
27,4," it risks reinventing the wheel around key questions for which there might be a consid-"
27,5," erable knowledge base (e.g., are cash transfers spent wisely? Do quasi-UBI programs"
27,6," discourage work?); (3) it widens the gulf between the actual shape of a program and its"
27,7," expectations; and (4) it may not always elucidate the nuanced, distinct features that a"
27,8," suite of alternative social protection measures possess to pursue similar objectives. Pilot-"
27,9," ing at least two features of a classic UBI might still produce insightful information, as well"
27,10," as elicit public and policy debates. However, there are systemwide questions—around"
27,11," financing, inflation, linkages to pensions, relationship to minimum wages, and the polit-"
27,12," ical economy—that pilots cannot fully answer."
27,13,"        A UBI is a program to be delivered in cash, unconditionally, and to everyone. A UBI"
27,14," is the simple combination of three complex debates (figure O.1). Its design features—all"
27,15," in cash, no conditions, and no targeting—challenge current practices to varying degrees."

28,2,"For instance, while those three core choices largely shape the identity of a UBI, propos-"
28,3,"als differ somewhat in their parameters about how much or how often to pay, whether"
28,4,"to include truly everyone or exclude children and noncitizens, and whether some people"
28,5,"would be net payers for the program (the latter two considerations already compromise"
28,6,"the no-targeting principle). The dramatic expansion in cash transfer programs globally,"
28,7,"and the generally positive evidence underlying them, suggests that the “in cash” part of"
28,8,"the UBI design may be relatively uncontroversial. Nonetheless, the large-scale in-kind"
28,9,"and food-based assistance programs present in virtually every country suggest that soci-"
28,10,"eties still opt to maintain a combination of transfer modalities, based on philosophical,"
28,11,"political economy, and technical grounds (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 2018). In"
28,12,"fact, especially in low-income and fragile settings, there might be locations or periods"
28,13,"where large-scale cash programming might be less suitable than in-kind provisions. Sim-"
28,14,"ilarly, there are many unconditional programs coexisting with a variety of conditional"
28,15,"ones, showing again a tension between giving recipients autonomy and taking a some-"
28,16,"what more directive approach (Marinescu 2018; Ravallion 2018). But perhaps the aspects"
28,17,"of UBI that most challenge current practice are reaching everyone and doing so with an"
28,18,"equal amount of support, independent of needs (Hanna and Olken 2018)."
28,19,"       It is important to note the diversity in definitions of “coverage” and “universality,”"
28,20,"as well as recognize the multiple pathways toward universality (Gentilini, Grosh, and"
28,21,"Rutkowski 2019; Packard et al. 2019). For example, universality can be interpreted in"
28,22,"terms of outcomes (e.g., all people should be guaranteed a minimum level of welfare)"
28,23,"or of receipt (“everyone should be covered”). The social insurance and health literature"
28,24,"defines coverage in risk terms (a payout is a promise for a payment in case a speci-"
28,25,"fied event occurs). In social assistance terms, coverage is receipt based—people are"
28,26,"considered covered only when transfers are actually received. Similarly, some consider"
28,27,"a universal transfer to be one based on no other criteria than age (thus many social"
28,28,"pension programs would be considered universal); others define universality as reach-"
28,29,"ing everyone in society independent of age, income, or other criteria (this view would"
28,30,"classify child grants and social pensions as categorical programs targeted by age). In"
28,31,"the book, we use coverage in social assistance terms, and universality as applying to all"
28,32,"society. But a UBI is not the only path toward universality, but rather one among many."
28,33,"Universality should be considered at the system level: universality in social protection,"
28,34,"which lies at the core of global commitments and the rights architecture, does not neces-"
28,35,"sarily imply universality via a single program. Whether through a UBI or social protection"
28,36,"more broadly, universality would need to be progressive and ensure that the most in"
28,37,"need receive support to meet their wider range of vulnerabilities and necessities. A grad-"
28,38,"ual building of a solid platform of social assistance, whether via one program or many,"
28,39,"should proceed from the bottom up."
28,40,"       Focusing on the “U” of UBI, the rationale for making transfers universal rests on"
28,41,"five main arguments. First, by not establishing eligibility criteria (besides perhaps cit-"
28,42,"izenship or established residency and age, e.g., for those above age 18), universality"
28,43,"circumvents the contentious issue of exclusion and inclusion errors that are inherent"
28,44,"in needs-based targeting. Under a UBI, there would be no such errors, as everybody is"
28,45,
29,1,"Overview: Exploring Universal Basic Income                                                      5"
29,2,"included by design, hence achieving substantial expansions in coverage. Second, uni-"
29,3,"versality may eliminate any stigma affecting beneficiaries. Evidence from Europe, for"
29,4,"example, shows that shame is among the key factors behind limited take-up of benefits"
29,5,"by eligible beneficiaries. Third, by changing the default position of people from being"
29,6,"potential beneficiaries (subject to eligibility verification) to guaranteed recipients, there"
29,7,"may be fewer transaction costs involved in accessing benefits (e.g., there is no need to"
29,8,"spend time in applying), and various economic and psychological benefits stemming"
29,9,"from a stable source of income over time (e.g., stress reduction, empowerment, avoiding"
29,10,"taking desperate actions out of economic hardship). Fourth, a universal transfer would"
29,11,"be more labor compatible than most programs, as it removes the price effect of transfers"
29,12,"(i.e., the reduction in labor supply to avoid a reduction in benefits). And finally, universal-"
29,13,"ity may strengthen programs’ political sustainability as beneficiaries (and voters) would"
29,14,"draw from the entire income distribution."
29,15,"        The case against the “U” in UBI rests principally on cost, fit for purpose, and a differ-"
29,16,"ent appreciation of the magnitude of its possible benefits. The cost of making significant"
29,17,"transfers universal is quite high. Depending on how these are financed—a reduction in"
29,18,"existing social protection spending, a reduction in regressive subsidies, increased taxes—"
29,19,"there are important changes in distributional outcomes among income and age groups"
29,20,"that may or may not be desirable. Additionally, the flat benefit structure may not be fit"
29,21,"for all purposes. It cannot be as redistributive as a more progressive structure and thus"
29,22,"may have muted impacts on poverty and inequality. The flat structure does not respond"
29,23,"to large and often short-run changes of state such as catastrophic illness, loss of job, or"
29,24,"loss of assets and livelihoods in a natural disaster, and thus may be insufficient to pro-"
29,25,"vide income smoothing in these cases. The political economy argument that universality"
29,26,"begets political support and increased budgets is reasonable, but not well supported in"
29,27,"country programming (Desai and Kharas 2017). Practices can be improved in more tar-"
29,28,"geted programs to reduce transaction costs and lower stigma. And finally, significant"
29,29,"evidence shows that current social assistance programming has not reduced work effort."
29,30,"        These emerging considerations point to the need for an organizing framework to"
29,31,"guide decision-making processes. We propose a basic framework to clarify, locate, and"
29,32,"assess the viability of a UBI (figure O.2). This is organized around four components."
29,33,"        •• It is important to have a clear understanding of the performance of the current tax"
29,34,"           and transfer system in a given context. This can be challenging in settings with"
29,35,"           limited information, a nearly nonexistent tax base, and fragmented social pro-"
29,36,"           tection programs."
29,37,"        •• The specific objective of the UBI among the many pursued, and design parame-"
29,38,"           ters devised accordingly. For example, if the objective is to counter the effects of"
29,39,"           automation-induced job losses, transfers should be provided for an amount ade-"
29,40,"           quate to ensure a minimum living standard. If the objective is to provide a social"
29,41,"           assistance function, transfers could be set in relation to poverty or food-insecu-"

30,32,"            provided on top of them. If the former, assessments should be made against"
30,33,"            those specific programs to be substituted."
30,34,"       •• When these choices have been made, a UBI should be compared to the existing"
30,35,"            system in light of eight metrics. These metrics are coverage, level of progressivity,"
30,36,"            adequacy of transfers, household incentives and behavioral responses, costs,"
30,37,"            financing options, political economy, and delivery. No program would score opti-"
30,38,"            mally on all dimensions, nor utterly low on all of them. Clearly, societies may"
30,39,"            place a particular weight on some metrics as opposed to others; for example,"
30,40,"            some may favor coverage, others progressivity. Therefore, the art of decision"
30,41,"            making would hinge on an understanding of the trade-offs across the overall"
30,42,"            collection of implications that span between a UBI and the counterfactual (the"
30,43,"            existing system)."
30,44,"       •• The above considerations need to be weighted by policy makers. Such a process"
30,45,"            would involve a clear-eyed view on the scope, expected performance, and trade-"
30,46,"            offs involved. Importantly, the introduction of a UBI should be assessed not only"
30,47,"            against the possible interventions it replaces, but also at the system level—for"
30,48,"            example, how does a UBI affect the overall composition and outlook of the wider"
30,49,"            social assistance and social protection system."
30,50,"       Our volume is designed to recognize and inform these trade-offs, with the chapter"
30,51,"organization and content closely matching this framework. For instance, our simulations"
30,52,"in chapter 4 offer an illustration of how to consider the various metrics of the frame-"
30,53,"work presented in figure O.2. In particular, we compare the replacement of selected"
30,54,"social assistance programs with a UBI. We simulate a full range of options in terms of"

31,3,"Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Nepal, the Russian Federation, and"
31,4,"South Africa) representing an array of contexts and diverse social protection systems."
31,5,"The microsimulations are based on recent representative household survey data and"
31,6,"provide new insights into the trade-offs between coverage, poverty impact, transfer ade-"
31,7,"quacy, and the budgetary implications of a UBI relative to the status quo. We begin with"
31,8,"a budget-neutral scenario, whereby a UBI is simply replacing selected noncontributory"
31,9,"social assistance programs. (In fact, we argue that a UBI should not be directly compared"
31,10,"to or assessed as a replacement for pension insurance or other contributory programs.)"
31,11,"We then gradually increase the generosity of the UBI transfer to the level of the full value"
31,12,"of the poverty line, thus ensuring that, by design, poverty is eliminated. For these scenar-"
31,13,"ios of increased generosity, we weigh financing options, contrasting increasing direct or"
31,14,"indirect taxes combined with other fiscal policy options, such as elimination of subsidies"
31,15,"or reallocation of public spending."
31,16,"      Under a budget-neutral scenario, the poverty impact of targeted programs is higher"
31,17,"than that of a UBI. With one exception (Russia), and even if imperfectly targeted, the"
31,18,"poverty impacts of existing programs (measured in terms of the squared poverty gap,"
31,19,"which better captures extreme poverty) are higher than the poverty impacts of a UBI"
31,20,"(figure O.3). The difference in impact is small in absolute terms, but quite sizable in rela-"
31,21,"tive terms. In fact, existing programs are on average about 60 percent more effective in"
31,22,"poverty reduction than a UBI. This is because most existing programs, even if they may"
31,23,"be only slightly progressive and miss some of the poor, tend to cover relatively more of"
31,24,"the extremely poor population. Therefore, with a few exceptions, a budget-neutral UBI"
31,25,"reform would take resources away from poor households that are benefiting from exist-"
31,26,"ing programs, giving them to richer households currently not benefiting. Importantly,"
31,27,"these findings do not account, or do so only indirectly, for other poverty-related aspects"

32,3,"tive data—for example, transaction costs to access benefits, stigma, and leakages."
32,4,"      A budget-neutral UBI reform leads to significant distributional impacts. While in"
32,5,"some countries, differences in poverty impacts remain modest, on average a UBI reform"
32,6,"would generate more winners than losers among the poorest segments of the popu-"
32,7,"lation. On average, across our sample of 10 countries, 70 percent of the population in"
32,8,"the two poorest deciles stands to gain from a budget-neutral UBI reform; this propor-"
32,9,"tion increases to 92 percent moving toward the richest decile. However, across deciles,"
32,10,"people losing from a budget-neutral UBI reform would lose substantially more than the"
32,11,"winners would stand to gain. When measured as a percentage of each country’s average"
32,12,"disposable income, the winners among the bottom deciles would gain about 1.7 per-"
32,13,"cent, while 30 percent of the people would lose between 3.5 and 5.0 percent (figure O.4)."
32,14,"      Not surprisingly, when a UBI replaces regressive measures, it makes poor house-"
32,15,"holds better off. This finding is intuitive: by being flat, a UBI would benefit those at the"
32,16,"bottom of the distribution more than a regressive measure. The magnitude is demon-"
32,17,"strated in the literature for energy subsidies in India (Coady and Prady 2018), and a"
32,18,"simulated compensation for broadening regressive value-added (VAT) taxes in four Afri-"
32,19,"can countries (Harris et al. 2018). A UBI would make virtually all households in the"
32,20,"poorest 40 percent of the population better off (and would actually benefit most of those"
32,21,"up to the 70th percentile). Such a regressive-to-flat shift could establish the basis for"
32,22,"further sequential recalibration of the distribution, including toward progressivity: the"
32,23,"Islamic Republic of Iran, for instance, first replaced energy subsidies with a UBI, and then"
32,24,"used affluence tests for excluding those at the top, thus putting the program on a more"
32,25,"progressive path."
32,26,"      The poverty effectiveness of a UBI can be enhanced by providing more generous"
32,27,"transfers, but these can quickly become fiscally unsustainable, especially in low-income"

33,2,"settings. In Nepal and Mozambique, providing every citizen with a transfer equal to the"
33,3,"average distance of the poor from the poverty line would cost 7 and 20 percent of gross"
33,4,"domestic product (GDP), respectively; though in middle-income countries, the cost of"
33,5,"this scenario would never exceed 8 percent of GDP. If a UBI is given for an amount suffi-"
33,6,"cient to eradicate poverty, it would cost much more—between 36 and 48 percent of GDP"
33,7,"in low-income Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal; and between 8 and 22 percent of GDP in"
33,8,"the other countries."
33,9,"      Financing generous UBI transfers requires significant increases in taxation of the"
33,10,"more affluent or complex public spending reforms (Ortiz et al. 2018). In most low- and"
33,11,"middle-income countries, the richest deciles contribute overwhelmingly to overall tax"
33,12,"revenues. Accordingly, differences in poverty impacts across taxation scenarios (direct"
33,13,"versus indirect or lump sum) remain small overall, and the poverty impacts taking taxa-"
33,14,"tion into consideration are only slightly smaller than the gross poverty impacts without"
33,15,"considering the financing side. This is good news for a UBI, but mobilizing the needed"
33,16,"resources is a challenge. Financing a UBI with meaningful poverty impacts may require"
33,17,"a complex mix of sources. Conversion of subsidies is an option in some contexts; but"
33,18,"with some exceptions, subsidy reforms will not cover the cost of meaningful UBI trans-"
33,19,"fers—on top of being a formidable political economy challenge. Revenues from natural"
33,20,"resources are a more promising fiscal outlet, but these are often highly volatile. In a con-"
33,21,"text not included in simulations such as Alaska, for example, the annual change in UBI"
33,22,"dividends could be up to 110 percent. Taxing the rich to finance a UBI with meaning-"
33,23,"ful impacts on poverty would also require levels that are politically prohibitive in most"
33,24,"countries. In India, for instance, direct taxes on the top decile would need to rise from"
33,25,"2.2 percent to 68.4 percent; in Brazil, from 7.2 percent to 24.5 percent; in South Africa,"
33,26,"from 19.9 percent to 40.3 percent; and in Chile, from 5.4 percent to 38.4 percent. The"
33,27,"only case in which additional taxation has more moderate impacts is Russia, where the"
33,28,"incidence would need to increase from 9.0 percent to 13.2 percent. Financing a UBI"
33,29,"with indirect taxes would put a lower—but still significant—burden on the top deciles,"
33,30,"but would also add a heavy burden on the middle classes that pay consumption taxes."
33,31,"      Employment-related incentives are another source of concern among policy"
33,32,"makers. Recurrent concerns over the negative effects of a UBI on labor markets might"
33,33,"be overstated. We review and frame global evidence on cash transfers and labor market"
33,34,"outcomes. Clarifying this issue helps dispel misconceptions around work incentives, con-"
33,35,"ditions of paid work and worker bargaining power, the valuation and distribution of"
33,36,"unpaid work, and formal and informal employment. Because of the paucity of real-"
33,37,"world experiences, we examine evidence from programs we consider informative, but"
33,38,"that are not fully consistent with a UBI. While external validity for such considerations"
33,39,"should be interpreted with caution, trends in evidence for large-scale programs are quite"
33,40,"consistent and are likely to be relevant for a UBI should it be implemented. With regard"
33,41,"to participation in paid work, fears are often exaggerated relative to existing evidence."
33,42,"Evaluations show that changes in livelihoods and labor market occupations occur, and"
33,43,"that such changes per se should not be considered negative. In fact, labor market distor-"
33,44,"tions remain relatively modest. And transfers may have positive effects on labor markets"
33,45,
34,1,"10                            Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, Jamele Rigolini, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
34,2,"when recipients use them to invest in family livelihoods or in their children’s human"
34,3,"capital."
34,4,"       Possible inflationary risks should not be dismissed a priori, nor should they be"
34,5,"overly magnified. Very often, UBI supporters point out that cash would lead to increased"
34,6,"competition among market actors, thus reducing prices (perhaps with only short-term"
34,7,"price adjustments). In other words, it is posited that suppliers of goods and services will"
34,8,"efficiently respond to the additional, cash-induced, effective demand. The available esti-"
34,9,"mates on multipliers, which range from 0.80 to 2.52 for every dollar injected, provides"
34,10,"some supportive evidence in that direction. However, the experience of countries such"
34,11,"as Australia, Kuwait, Mexico, and the Philippines present contrasting effects. We argue"
34,12,"that context matters, and that inflationary effects should be assessed within the frame-"
34,13,"work of analytical parameters such as overall market competitiveness and conditions"
34,14,"(e.g., a significant injection of cash in weakly integrated markets may cause inflation),"
34,15,"the specific market for subproducts and services, program size, and probably interven-"
34,16,"tion duration."
34,17,"       The political economy of UBI remains vastly underexplored. There are several cru-"
34,18,"cial political economy threads in a UBI—for example, in support for current systems, in"
34,19,"how to replace a portion of current programs, and in resource mobilization. All of these"
34,20,"present a large number of stakeholders with differing interests and incentives. The pace"
34,21,"of possible introduction also matters. For example, if countries choose to expand cate-"
34,22,"gorical transfers (e.g., universal child grants), these could provide an area to inform a"
34,23,"number of UBI-type questions. In the medium term, these quasi-UBI programs may help"
34,24,"in better understanding the effects of bounded universality (including its financing) and"
34,25,"help build more inclusive delivery platforms—all the while unlocking the potential for"
34,26,"higher coverage. The poverty effectiveness of categorical programs would depend on"
34,27,"whether and how much age characteristics correlate with poverty, although they will be"
34,28,"significantly more expensive than poverty-targeted programs. A gradual adoption of a"
34,29,"UBI does not, however, eliminate core political economy challenges. For instance, piece-"
34,30,"meal introduction may worsen path dependency challenges. Groups that are likely to"
34,31,"gain from the first forms of a UBI may see its further expansion as a threat and block it."
34,32,"Experimentation trajectories are fraught with various risks. They often reflect a political"
34,33,"bandwagon effect—that is, expressions of “cheap” support across the political spectrum"
34,34,"with low actual commitment to subsequent larger-scale implementation."
34,35,"       The UBI’s overall design features suggest that it may fit certain configurations of"
34,36,"societal welfare attitudes and preferences more than others. In many cases, program"
34,37,"design may reflect historical, philosophical, and moral norms around if and how indi-"
34,38,"viduals are expected to reciprocate public assistance. In some societies, for instance, the"
34,39,"concept of work constitutes the primary lens through which the exchange of individual"
34,40,"rights and responsibilities is interpreted—and that is reflected in the choice and design"
34,41,"of social assistance interventions. The U.S. safety net, for instance, is overwhelmingly"
34,42,"in kind, focused on families with children and on work (Hoynes and Rothstein 2019). At"
34,43,"the opposite end of the income spectrum, Ethiopia places a strong emphasis on work as"
34,44,"well, with its safety net anchored in public works. In other contexts, societal preferences"
34,45,
35,1,"Overview: Exploring Universal Basic Income                                                 11"
35,2,"might differ—for example, work may share primacy with other values, such as family"
35,3,"time or community care, which may lessen expectations of reciprocity via work. In"
35,4,"Africa, studies have shown that the public acceptability of a universal program hinges on"
35,5,"how well it aligns with prevailing notions of deservingness (Davis et al. 2016)."
35,6,"       When operating at full scale, implementation of a UBI might be relatively simple"
35,7,"and streamlined—but getting to that point is easier said than done. We identify core"
35,8,"delivery elements and processes that serve a mainstream social assistance program,"
35,9,"and illustrate how these elements and processes should be adapted to operationalize"
35,10,"a UBI. We discuss pragmatic issues around eligibility, outreach, registration, payments,"
35,11,"grievance redress, and other program-level mechanisms as well as overarching or foun-"
35,12,"dational issues related to identification, interoperability, and data protection. When"
35,13,"viewed through an implementation lens, a UBI is based on the same elements as those"
35,14,"supporting the delivery of other social protection programs. A UBI may offer some sim-"
35,15,"plifications that would enable extension of coverage (broader awareness of the program,"
35,16,"reduced beneficiary transaction costs, and no complex tests for eligibility and targeting"
35,17,"processes). But challenges in covering the poor go beyond targeting and encompass a"
35,18,"range of practical bottlenecks across the delivery chain—which by itself, a UBI cannot"
35,19,"overcome (Lindert, George, and Rodriguez-Caillava, forthcoming). Moreover, working at"
35,20,"a universal scale entails challenges of its own. Very few, if any, low- and middle-income"
35,21,"countries may be ready to have a UBI in its full version implemented in the short term."
35,22,"Countries that are the closest to the feasibility frontier are those that may need a UBI the"
35,23,"least (assuming that coverage of the poor, which is already very high, is the primary goal"
35,24,"of a UBI introduction)."
35,25,"       So where would a UBI be more or less likely to be an appropriate option? Our anal-"
35,26,"ysis, based on both generation of new results and extensive review of the theoretical and"
35,27,"operational literature, points to some stylized implications for different contexts. These"
35,28,"could be summarized as follows:"
35,29,"       •• Where social assistance provides relatively adequate benefits, substantial cov-"
35,30,"          erage, and slight to marked progressivity, policy makers could consider tackling"
35,31,"          specific bottlenecks that hamper eligibility, access, coverage, or delivery within"
35,32,"          the existing system. If a UBI is to be considered, it may have to be motivated by"
35,33,"          objectives other than a poverty-related one (e.g., automation-driven job insecu-"
35,34,"          rity, social dividends, etc.)."
35,35,"       •• Where coverage is high, but not progressive, a UBI could be considered an"
35,36,"          option, although some vulnerable (age) groups may suffer from the shift."
35,37,"       •• Where social assistance is limited but provided progressively, a UBI would"
35,38,"          extend coverage but also flatten the distribution. If budget neutral, this means"
35,39,"          “less money for more people,” and likely “less at the bottom.”"
35,40,"       •• Where social assistance is patchy and flat or regressive, a UBI could be an option"
35,41,"          to expand coverage if financed via progressive income taxation, elimination"
35,42,"          of energy subsidies, or redistribution of windfall revenues. Most low-income"
35,43,
36,1,"12                          Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, Jamele Rigolini, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
36,2,"      countries may not display those financing features; but some middle-income,"
36,3,"      resource-rich countries may do so."
36,4,"   •• For a typical low-income setting, a UBI could expand coverage, but is clearly"
36,5,"      financially daunting. Other factors, such as diversity in contexts at the subna-"
36,6,"      tional level (e.g., remote areas with little connection to markets, etc.), may also"
36,7,"      suggest the need for design flexibility (e.g., a balance of in-kind and cash trans-"
36,8,"      fers, sensible ways to account for children, etc.), thus possibly making the rigid"
36,9,"      design of a UBI less palatable."
36,10,"   The book is structured around seven chapters."
36,11,"   •• In chapter 1, Gentilini, Grosh, and Yemtsov clarify the definition of UBI, offer"
36,12,"      an overview of the design choices underpinning it, and discuss the correspond-"
36,13,"      ing evidence base. The discussion is then extended to key thematic areas that"
36,14,"      trigger interest in a UBI, including changes in labor markets, social protection"
36,15,"      reform, governance of natural resource wealth, and the rights agenda. Finally,"
36,16,"      the chapter reviews lessons stemming from practical experiences, including"
36,17,"      pilot trials and larger-scale schemes."
36,18,"   •• In chapter 2, Gentilini and Grosh put UBI in perspective by comparing it to other"
36,19,"      social assistance interventions. A UBI is often confused with other measures"
36,20,"      such as a guaranteed minimum income and a negative income tax. In Italy, for"
36,21,"      instance, at the time of writing this report, the citizens income program is being"
36,22,"      presented as a UBI while actually being a slightly expanded form of a guar-"
36,23,"      anteed minimum income. Similar considerations stem from the United States,"
36,24,"      Finland, and elsewhere. The chapter thus clarifies the analytical and practical"
36,25,"      differences between various options, including benefit and tax-based measures,"
36,26,"      and both wage- and nonwage-oriented schemes. The chapter compares and"
36,27,"      reviews benefit structures and succinctly identifies comparative advantages and"
36,28,"      limitations. It thereby provides thumbnail sketches of other program options"
36,29,"      against which a UBI could be selected."
36,30,"   •• Following the analytical foundations laid out in the first two chapters, chap-"
36,31,"      ter 3, authored by Bastagli, examines one of the most contentious quandaries"
36,32,"      and concerns among policy makers: the interface between UBI and work. The"
36,33,"      chapter critically reviews and discusses the arguments and evidence on the"
36,34,"      links between UBI and four work-related outcomes: participation and hours in"
36,35,"      paid work; the conditions of paid work (e.g., whether a UBI would strengthen"
36,36,"      bargaining power); the recognition, valuation, and distribution of unpaid work"
36,37,"      (could a UBI be considered a way of remunerating unpaid work); and formal and"
36,38,"      informal employment."
36,39,"   •• Chapter 4 generates new analysis and insights from microsimulations. Rigo-"
36,40,"      lini, Lustig, Gentilini, Monsalve, and Quan provide evidence on the impacts,"
36,41,
37,1,"Overview: Exploring Universal Basic Income                                               13"
37,2,"         costs, and distributional implications of the UBI based on simulations. They look"
37,3,"         at the poverty and inequality impact of social protection systems when income"
37,4,"         support programs are replaced with UBI schemes of various levels of gener-"
37,5,"         osity. They do so using household survey data for 10 low- and middle-income"
37,6,"         countries and provide a nuanced explanation of the factors shaping program"
37,7,"         performance. They study the spending and financing sides of UBI for six mid-"
37,8,"         dle-income countries using taxation data from Tulane University’s Commitment"
37,9,"         to Equity Data Center."
37,10,"      •• The last three chapters (chapters 5, 6, and 7) examine real-world financial,"
37,11,"         political, and operational issues. Decisions about a UBI should be taken in con-"
37,12,"         junction with decisions about its financing. So in chapter 5, Ter-Minassian"
37,13,"         lays out alternative financing options for a UBI. The chapter provides practical"
37,14,"         considerations—a primer—to assess the fiscal space and revenue mobilization"
37,15,"         measures to finance different levels of a UBI."
37,16,"      •• The political economy of the UBI is discussed in chapter 6. De Wispelaere"
37,17,"         and Yemtsov provide an overview of theories and experiences with political"
37,18,"         economy reforms around the idea of UBI, drawing from existing literature and"
37,19,"         initiatives that are receiving considerable public and analytical attention. The"
37,20,"         chapter specifically examines experiences and issues around political con-"
37,21,"         stituencies and coalitions that can affect whether and how a UBI might be a"
37,22,"         politically viable option."
37,23,"      •• Chapter 7 provides a framework for thinking about how to implement a UBI,"
37,24,"         including core requirements across a stylized delivery chain. This chapter, by"
37,25,"         Lowe, George, Grosh, and Gentilini, identifies a number of functions and activ-"
37,26,"         ities that would serve a mainstream social assistance program, and illustrates"
37,27,"         how those processes should be adapted to operationalize a UBI in practice. The"
37,28,"         chapter discusses pragmatic issues around eligibility, outreach, registration,"
37,29,"         payments, grievance redress, and other programmatic mechanisms, as well as"
37,30,"         overarching and foundational issues related to identification, interoperability,"
37,31,"         and data protection."
37,32,"      The chapters are complemented by five appendixes. These are an inventory of"
37,33,"existing or past UBI program design features (appendix A), a structured compilation of"
37,34,"UBI-related proposals (appendix B), a granular mapping of impacts from design choices"
37,35,"related to conditionality (appendix C), a technical discussion of the data and methodol-"
37,36,"ogy for the microsimulations in chapter 4 (appendix D), and an annotated bibliography"
37,37,"(appendix E) dovetailing with the chapter-specific references."

41,3,"Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
41,4,"M"
41,5,"             artin Luther King Jr set forth an idea to advance inclusive economic opportu-"
41,6,"             nity. It was an idea that fascinated Keynesians like James Tobin and libertarians"
41,7,"             like Milton Friedman. It stirred controversy in the 2017 French elections and"
41,8,"             is currently piloted in rural Kenya. It is one that charms and polarizes in equal"
41,9,"measure, and its revolutionary simplicity is summed up in three words: cash for everyone."
41,10,"      It is no surprise that the idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has elicited such"
41,11,"waves of interest across time and space. In part this is precisely because it is an idea, and"
41,12,"not merely a program. As Lowrey (2018, 191) recently put it, “…a UBI is a lesson and"
41,13,"an ideal, not just an economic policy.” Indeed, discussions on UBI are often a proxy for"
41,14,"broader debates around the role of the state and markets, and the distribution of power"
41,15,"within societies: “[UBI] is not just a form of redistribution; it is a moral statement” notes"
41,16,"Sir Tony Atkinson (Atkinson 2011, 4)."
41,17,"      At the time of writing this volume, there were 126 books on UBI, 91 of which had"
41,18,"been produced since 2010 alone—that is, an average of one book released each month."
41,19,"Similar statistics emerge in newspaper quotes (Hoynes and Rothstein 2019). At least"
41,20,"36 policy proposals have been tabled, and 22 pilot programs fielded; and our bibliog-"
41,21,"raphy (appendix E) lists 200 titles of direct and indirect relevance to the topic. Since"
41,22,"1986, a Basic Income Earth Network has brought together a rich cadre of policy makers,"
41,23,"practitioners, and academics. In 2016, Switzerland held a referendum on adopting a"
41,24,"UBI. Documentaries are springing up,1 and some politicians have made UBI a central"
41,25,"platform of their campaigns.2 The United Nations Secretary-General recently called for"
41,26,"“stronger safety nets, and eventually universal basic income” (Guterres 2018), while in"
41,27,"India it was predicted that “…within the next two years, at least one or two [Indian]"

42,1,"18                                            Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
42,2,"states will implement universal basic income” (Indian Economic Times 2018). The inevi-"
42,3,"tability of UBI is almost a mantra in Silicon Valley.3"
42,4,"       But what is a UBI concretely? What parameters should a policy maker consider to com-"
42,5,"prehend and ponder its implications? What compelling lessons are emerging from practical"
42,6,"experiences? A more granular examination of the literature shows that the definition, ana-"
42,7,"lytical foundations, expectations, and practical insights on UBI can all vary significantly"
42,8,"(Bregman 2017; Calnitsky 2017; Murray 2016; Standing 2017; Stern 2016; Van Parijs and"
42,9,"Vanderborght 2017; Widerquist et al. 2013). Such heterogeneity may help in building initial"
42,10,"momentum and generate public interest, but it could undermine a coherent and structured"
42,11,"policy discussion. This chapter unbundles and clarifies core layers of debates surrounding"
42,12,"the UBI concept with the aim of providing a compass to navigate the idea."
42,13,"       After a short historical excursus on the origins of today’s UBI debates, we lay out the"
42,14,"main design contours of a UBI and trace key empirical debates underlying the choice of"
42,15,"practical parameters. Universality, conditionality, transfer modality—as well as a set of six"
42,16,"other choices—are unbundled and examined in the next section. The broad ecosystem of"
42,17,"UBI involves different stylized narratives, which are the subject of the fourth section of this"
42,18,"chapter. In particular, UBI is interpreted in the context of social assistance reforms, rights-"
42,19,"based approaches, automation and labor market disruptions, and resource dividends and"
42,20,"state-citizen accountability. Such narratives are complemented with emerging lessons"
42,21,"from country and subnational experiences. The chapter’s final section offers a set of con-"
42,22,"cluding reflections on the analytics and practice of UBI as a social protection instrument."
42,23,"A Glimpse at History"
42,24,"Contemporary social protection systems are the result of century-long experiences on"
42,25,"how states manage risks in the context of evolving economic, social, institutional, and"
42,26,"technological forces. So why has UBI increasingly emerged as a way—or a strawman,"
42,27,"according to some—to challenge and rethink such systems? In this section, we step back"
42,28,"for a moment and consider four main phases in the evolution of social protection (Hickel"
42,29,"2017; Lindert 2004; Ravallion 2016; Smith 2011)."
42,30,"       The first phase, which runs up to around 1600, is characterized by a dearth of"
42,31,"public support against destitution. The seminal work by Vives (1526), through his advice"
42,32,"to the city of Bruges, constitutes one of the first contributions in outlining a clear ratio-"
42,33,"nale for poverty-related transfers by the state. Societies were largely rural, workers were"
42,34,"mostly self-employed, and agricultural production was generally organized along feudal"
42,35,"lines. Households managed life-cycle and other risks through informal arrangements,"
42,36,"community sharing, or similar strategies. This order was disrupted by the ‘enclosure’"
42,37,"process in England (or the privatization of common land) which, while increasing agri-"
42,38,"cultural productivity, gave birth to ‘poverty’ as societal phenomenon (Hickel 2017)."
42,39,"       Vives’s thinking influenced the first British Old Poor Law of 1601, which initiated a"
42,40,"second phase for social protection. Adopted after periods of riots and famines, the Old"
42,41,"Poor Law formalized the provision of limited public transfers for specific shocks, such as"
42,42,
43,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                            19"
43,2,"old age, widowhood, disability, illness, or unemployment. The Old Poor Law was legally"
43,3,"enforceable, financed by local taxes on landlords, and provided a minimum guarantee"
43,4,"that, while modest, was open to anyone in need. By the late 17th century, almost all par-"
43,5,"ishes of England were covered by the Old Poor Law.4"
43,6,"      The advent of the Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped how people"
43,7,"lived. The emergence of landless populations, large-scale migration to cities, and heavy"
43,8,"dependence on wage employment marked a structural shift that would have profound"
43,9,"implications for social protection. The masses flocking to cities left parishes to finance"
43,10,"rising support bills for children and the elderly. This led, by 1818, to a sixfold increase"
43,11,"in the tax rate to finance the Old Poor Law compared to the mid-1700s. Strong backlash"
43,12,"from landlords against the Old Poor Law ensued, with stricter measures such as the dis-"
43,13,"tinction between “deserving” and “undeserving” poor emerging around this time."
43,14,"      Significant reforms were enacted with a New Poor Law of 1834. As a result, spend-"
43,15,"ing for poor relief was slashed from 2.5 percent to 1.0 percent of gross domestic product"
43,16,"(GDP). This was compounded by a wider use of workhouses, which provided meager"
43,17,"payments in kind and harsh working conditions. The thinking behind the Old and New"
43,18,"Poor Laws spread from the United Kingdom to its overseas territories and colonies, influ-"
43,19,"encing approaches to social protection in the United States, India, and parts of Africa"
43,20,"(Bhattacharya 2017; Harvey 2007; Mkandawire 2016; Seekings 2013).5 It was only a cen-"
43,21,"tury later that, with the Beveridge Report of 1942, workhouses were closed."
43,22,"      By the end of the 19th century, the industrialization process had remodeled the"
43,23,"societal fabric so profoundly that new ways of sharing risks were necessary. Contributory"
43,24,"insurance schemes appeared around this time, marking the beginning of a third phase in"
43,25,"social protection history. Although there were some antecedents, pensions can be traced"
43,26,"back to the German Bismarckian model of 1889. This was characterized by a financing"
43,27,"structure based primarily on employer and employee (and sometimes government) con-"
43,28,"tributions and benefits proportional to the covered worker’s salary."
43,29,"      Coverage gradually increased as a greater share of the workforce moved into facto-"
43,30,"ries and firms, and labor markets formalized—that is, workers and their employers were"
43,31,"registered and monitored to comply with various regulations, including social insurance"
43,32,"contributions from payroll, income, and corporate taxes. Various factors, such as colo-"
43,33,"nial approaches to welfare and pervasive informality, have prevented such risk-sharing"
43,34,"arrangements from being firmly embedded in most low- and middle-income coun-"
43,35,"tries (Packard et al. 2019; Seekings 2013). Currently, social insurance coverage is low"
43,36,"across most low- and middle-income countries. In Africa, on average, 10.6 percent of"
43,37,"the working-age population contributes to pension schemes (Guven 2019). Similarly, in"
43,38,"Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan, which have a combined population"
43,39,"of over 2.1 billion people, social insurance coverage is below or around 10 percent of the"
43,40,"economically active population, with generally limited progress registered over the past"
43,41,"decade6 (Rutkowski 2018)."
43,42,"      The global South witnessed a fourth phase of social protection—an explosion of"
43,43,"noncontributory social assistance (and social pension) programs, which are now nearly"
43,44,"ubiquitous worldwide (World Bank 2018a). In regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, the"
43,45,
44,1,"20                                           Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
44,2,"institutionalization of social assistance transfers is a relatively new phenomenon taking"
44,3,"root over the past quarter century. This was preceded by large-scale price subsidy"
44,4,"schemes and, in the post-colonial period, international humanitarian assistance (Ben-"
44,5,"nett, Foley, and Krebs 2016; Devereux 2001)."
44,6,"       Today social protection systems are composed of a varied, but often complex,"
44,7,"mix of programs. In some countries, the role of social protection was largely driven by"
44,8,"larger economic transformations, such as with the reform of state-owned enterprises in"
44,9,"China over the 1990s (Ang 2016; Gentilini 2015). Whether driven mostly by economic"
44,10,"or other forces, every country has a set of contributory social insurance programs and"
44,11,"further worker protections for those with formal sector labor contracts. In some coun-"
44,12,"tries, these provide risk management to a large part of the population; in other countries,"
44,13,"informality dominates and, as mentioned, social insurance provides protection to only a"
44,14,"few, though sometimes generously. Social assistance programs are usually small relative"
44,15,"to needs, programs to help households improve their jobs or earnings still smaller, and"
44,16,"social services even more limited. These latter three strands of social protection are often"
44,17,"characterized by multiple programs offered by different government agencies and/or for"
44,18,"different client segments. There may also be significant expenditures on food, energy,"
44,19,"fertilizer, or water subsidies that share some goals with social protection."
44,20,"       How do these four phases relate to current debates on UBI? One common thread"
44,21,"across the centuries is that social protection is a matter of struggle and hard-won gains"
44,22,"by coalitions of poor, working, and middle-class populations (Desai and Kharas 2017)."
44,23,"Eventually, social protection systems adapt to contemporary challenges, but rarely with-"
44,24,"out major crises, societal battles, or both. Institutions and polities take time to adjust to"
44,25,"a fast-paced, evolving society. Part of the narrative on UBI is that social protection sys-"
44,26,"tems, especially in higher-income countries, are being outpaced by structural shifts in"
44,27,"demographics, employment, and culture. In other words, countries have a 20th century"
44,28,"system to deal with 21st century challenges. The appetite for change is often palpable."
44,29,"       Reimagining social protection is an ongoing process, with hot debates around"
44,30,"the direction and modalities for change (Barr, forthcoming; Cottam 2019; Ortiz 2018;"
44,31,"Rutkowski 2018; Shafik 2018). But virtually every study underscores the importance of"
44,32,"social assistance as a foundational platform for the social protection system of the future."
44,33,"Would a UBI be part of a fifth social protection phase? Before answering this question,"
44,34,"we need to understand UBI better."
44,35,"Anatomy of UBI"
44,36,"In principle, social assistance schemes can be codified along three features or dimen-"
44,37,"sions: what transfer modality they provide, whether and how they are conditional, and"
44,38,"whether and how they are targeted. The cube proposed in figure 1.1 illustrates the pro-"
44,39,"grams that ensue from these combinations."
44,40,"       A UBI, highlighted in gold, is the combination of three choices—that is, a transfer"
44,41,"that is provided universally, unconditionally, and in cash. Within this framework, UBI"

45,32,"        Outlining the three overarching design parameters provides a framework for assess-"
45,33," ing whether current and past experiences would classify as UBI programs. As mentioned"
45,34," in the previous section, a range of pilot trials and broader schemes are or have been"
45,35," under way (Banerjee, Niehaus, and Suri 2019). But can they be considered a UBI?"

45,37," traits. In addition to the three core variables outlined above—conditionality, transfer"
45,38," modality, and universality—we here examine whether they are national or local in scope."
45,39," As chapter 6 further illustrates, the political economy of reform is a key issue in shaping"
45,40," UBI debates within social contracts. Many pilots are currently privately funded as a way"
45,41," to help jumpstart discussion and advance an evaluation agenda; in doing so, however,"
45,42," they may largely bypass the political, budgetary, and inter-institutional struggles that are"

47,31,"later in this chapter.7 The bulk of smaller-scale pilot experiences revolves around four"
47,32,"experiments in the United States, which also pioneered the use of randomized controlled"
47,33,"trials in the social sciences (Moffitt 2002, 2003). These were mostly negative income tax"
47,34,"experiments devised to inform President Nixon’s Family Assistance Plan (box 1.1), the"
47,35,"literature on which is extensive (Steensland 2007).8 In Kenya, a pilot is currently under"
47,36,"way covering 6,000 people for 12 years, with a second treatment arm of 11,500 people"
47,37,"for 2 years. Pilots in India took place in eight villages in Madhya Pradesh (Rs 300/adult"
47,38,"and Rs 150/child), with a similar scheme in a tribal village. Finland is undertaking a"
47,39,"randomized controlled trial providing 2,000 unemployed citizens with nearly US$600/"
47,40,"month over two years;9 Oakland, California, and 25 municipalities in the Netherlands"
47,41,"are about to start similar trial programs. Finally, in Namibia, a pilot UBI was conducted"
47,42,"in the Otjivero-Omitara area from 2007 to 2009, including the provision of about US$100"
47,43,"monthly to around 930 residents below the age of 60. This was financed by private con-"
47,44,"tributions and implemented by nongovernmental organizations. Descriptive statistics for"
47,45,"these pilots as well as for other initiatives are laid out in appendix A.10"

48,3,"    T   he first negative income tax pilot in New Jersey and Pennsylvania lasted from"
48,4,"        1968 until 1972 and had a sample size of 1,357 households from declining urban"
48,5,"    areas. A rural experiment conducted in Iowa and North Carolina from 1969 to 1973"
48,6,"    included 809 low-income rural families. The third pilot, which took place in Gary,"
48,7,"    Indiana, between 1971 and 1974, was composed of 1,780 African American house-"
48,8,"    holds, 59 percent of which were headed by single females. The largest experiment,"
48,9,"    which included 4,800 families, was conducted in Seattle and Denver from 1971 to"
48,10,"    1982. This trial not only offered recipients more generous benefit structures than"
48,11,"    the others, but also extended the duration from three to five years for a quarter"
48,12,"    of participants. The U.S. experience is mirrored by Canada’s Mincome scheme in"
48,13,"    Manitoba: running over 1975–79, it covered 1,300 households in the cities of Win-"
48,14,"    nipeg and Dauphin (Forget 2011, 2018; Munnell 1986; Pechman and Timpane 1975)."
48,15,"a consideration of choices around other parameters important to the shape and fit of a"
48,16,"particular UBI proposal into larger policy, but whose variations do not violate the defini-"
48,17,"tion of a UBI."
48,18,"Universality"
48,19,"The notion that social protection is universal rests on two elements: namely that every-"
48,20,"one is covered. In many cases, debate revolves around the “everyone” aspect—that is,"
48,21,"the rationale and modalities to cover all members of society and not just some. Yet, this"
48,22,"assumes clarity on the meaning of “coverage,” which is a big assumption."
48,23,"       In health insurance, for example, the goal is often to provide coverage to all, so that"
48,24,"in the event people become ill, they receive health services. The same principle is at play"
48,25,"for crop insurance. And for contributory pensions, unemployment, or disability insurance"
48,26,"programs, coverage is used in an analogous way. In most periods, people covered by such"
48,27,"insurance will benefit from a guarantee or a promise of help when needed (i.e., reaching"
48,28,"a certain age), but not necessarily from a payout (Gentilini, Grosh, and Rutkowski 2019)."
48,29,"       For social assistance, instead, coverage is often interpreted as receiving an actual"
48,30,"transfer. This is quite a difference and a critical issue to clarify given the implications for"
48,31,"universal social protection. For instance, if a country has a guaranteed minimum income"
48,32,"program that provides cash when incomes fall below a threshold, the social insurance"
48,33,"interpretation would be that—as in the case of health or pensions—everyone is covered"
48,34,"independent of the event occurring (i.e., income falling). Thus, coverage would be many"
48,35,"times greater than the actual benefit roster. A guaranteed minimum income is universal"
48,36,"in insurance terms, but it is targeted from a social assistance standpoint."
48,37,"       Part of the social assistance community refers to programs for the elderly or chil-"
48,38,"dren as universal. But what is really meant is that eligibility for such programs entails no"
48,39,
49,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                              25"
49,2,"requirement other than age—those who do not meet the requirement are excluded—"
49,3,"hence it is not for all. A “universal social pension,” for example, is again universal from"
49,4,"an insurance perspective, but it is targeted from a social assistance viewpoint."
49,5,"       There is also the question of whether coverage refers to gross or net benefit. While"
49,6,"with a UBI everyone receives a payout, those benefits must be financed. A UBI’s flat"
49,7,"and uniform character is necessarily altered once the financing is taken into account."
49,8,"When financing is via progressive income taxation, for example, some people will pay"
49,9,"more than the benefits they receive as a UBI payout. Thus, some people are nominally"
49,10,"beneficiaries, but de facto financiers. The program therefore ceases being universal in"
49,11,"practice."
49,12,"       Another important aspect of coverage is what benefit the coverage supplies. In"
49,13,"social assistance, it is generally a supplement to income, often a rather small one. But the"
49,14,"insurances are dimensioned in a way that relates to the size of the loss. Health insurance"
49,15,"provides benefits that are differentiated according to the problem. Unemployment insur-"
49,16,"ance pays more to replace wages for high-income workers than for lower-wage workers."
49,17,"It is meant to pay a lot during the (hopefully) short period of unemployment. Providing"
49,18,"coverage with a minor social assistance or UBI benefit would not match the payout the"
49,19,"same way insurance is designed to do."
49,20,"       UBI thus represents a shortcut in achieving universality. Yet there are different"
49,21,"ways of conceiving and defining universality in coverage. Universality should be consid-"
49,22,"ered at the system level: universality in social protection, which lies at the core of global"
49,23,"commitments and the rights architecture, does not necessarily imply universality via"
49,24,"a single program. Whether through a UBI or social protection more broadly, universal-"
49,25,"ity would need to be progressive, and ensure that the most in need receive support to"
49,26,"meet their wider range of vulnerabilities and necessities. A gradual building of a solid"
49,27,"platform of social assistance, whether via one program or not, should proceed from the"
49,28,"bottom up."
49,29,"Pros and Cons of Universality"
49,30,"The rationale for making transfers universal rests on five main arguments. First, by"
49,31,"not establishing eligibility criteria (besides perhaps citizenship or established residency"
49,32,"and age, e.g., for those above age 18), universality circumvents the contentious issue of"
49,33,"exclusion and inclusion errors that are inherent in needs-based targeting. Under a UBI,"
49,34,"there would be no such errors, as everybody is included by design, hence achieving sub-"
49,35,"stantial expansions in coverage (Ravallion 2018). Second, universality may eliminate any"
49,36,"stigma affecting beneficiaries. Evidence from Europe, for example, shows that shame is"
49,37,"among the key factors behind limited take-up of benefits by eligible beneficiaries (Atkin-"
49,38,"son 2015; Eurofound 2015)."
49,39,"       Third, by changing the default position of people from being potential benefi-"
49,40,"ciaries (subject to eligibility verification) to guaranteed recipients, there may be fewer"
49,41,"transaction costs involved in accessing benefits (e.g., there is no need to spend time"
49,42,"in applying).11 Also, there are various economic and psychological benefits stemming"
49,43,
50,1,"26                                              Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
50,2,"from a stable source of income over time (e.g., stress reduction, empowerment, avoid-"
50,3,"ing taking desperate actions out of economic hardship) (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013;"
50,4,"World Bank 2015). Fourth, a universal transfer would be more labor compatible than"
50,5,"most programs, as it removes the price effect of transfers (i.e., the reduction in labor"
50,6,"supply to avoid a reduction in benefits). And finally, universality may strengthen pro-"
50,7,"grams’ political sustainability as beneficiaries (and voters) would draw from the entire"
50,8,"income distribution. By being universal, UBI (and to some extent categorical programs"
50,9,"such as child allowances and social pensions) may draw together the interests of the"
50,10,"poor, the near poor, and even the middle class. Hence, the political economy of policy"
50,11,"choice and of taxation to support the programs would change to enlarge the resource"
50,12,"pool for social protection enough to expand coverage and maintain meaningful bene-"
50,13,"fits12 (Desai and Kharas 2017; Kidd 2015)."
50,14,"        The case against the “U” in UBI rests principally on cost, fit for purpose, and a"
50,15,"different appreciation for the magnitude of the possible benefits of UBI. First, the cost"
50,16,"of making significant transfers universal is quite high. Depending on how these are"
50,17,"financed—a reduction in existing social protection spending, a reduction in regressive"
50,18,"subsidies, increased taxes—there are important changes in distributional outcomes"
50,19,"among income and age groups that may or may not be desirable. We will come back"
50,20,"to this point when discussing figure 1.2 as well as in chapter 4. Second, the flat benefit"
50,21,"structure may not be fit for all purposes. It cannot be as redistributive as a more pro-"
50,22,"gressive structure and thus will have muted impacts on poverty and inequality. The flat"
50,23,"structure does not respond to large and often short-run changes of state such as cata-"
50,24,"strophic illness, loss of job, and loss of assets and livelihoods in a natural disaster, and"
50,25,"hence may be insufficient to provide income smoothing in these cases. The political"
50,26,"economy argument that universality begets political support and increased budgets is"
50,27,"not well supported in country programming. Practices can be improved in more targeted"
50,28,"programs to reduce transaction costs and lower stigma. And finally, significant evidence"
50,29,"shows that current social assistance programming has not reduced work effort (Baird,"
50,30,"McKenzie, and Özler 2018; Handa et al. 2018)."
50,31,"        Importantly, the evidence on the political economy of universality in transfers is"
50,32,"limited. While the elements of the hypothesis are intuitive, hard evidence on the magni-"
50,33,"tude of this effect is, by nature, difficult to come by.13 In Africa, for example, studies have"
50,34,"shown that whether a universal program is publicly acceptable—and hence represents"
50,35,"“good politics”—hinges on how well it aligns with prevailing notions of “deservingness”"
50,36,"(Hickey et al., forthcoming; Quarles van Ufford et al. 2016). Also, in the limited imple-"
50,37,"mentation of full UBI to date, they have all been funded not by direct or indirect taxation,"
50,38,"but by channeling natural resource revenues, energy subsidy reforms, or in the case of"
50,39,"some pilots, via private sector donations. Furthermore, when financing is considered,"
50,40,"a UBI may become a targeted intervention—one where both receipt and amount are"
50,41,"tapered out via taxes—hence resetting the discussion as not all people would benefit"
50,42,"equally or even benefit at all."

51,2,"Explaining Limited Coverage"
51,3,"Let us consider the causes of low coverage among the poorest households in current"
51,4,"systems, as well as if and how a UBI might help tackle them. The problem of limited"
51,5,"coverage is well documented: for example, estimates show that of the poorest quin-"
51,6,"tile of the population in each country, an average of 45 percent receives some form of"
51,7,"social assistance, while the share is only 18 percent in low-income countries (World"
51,8,"Bank 2018a)."
51,9,"         While several factors contribute to low coverage, they affect the problem in dif-"
51,10,"ferent ways. Table 1.2 summarizes four main barriers. A central issue, especially in"
51,11,"low-income countries, is low spending and fiscal constraints (Hanna and Olken 2018)."
51,12,"In Africa, for example, total safety net coverage is lower than the number of people in"
51,13,"poverty everywhere except Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa—so even"
51,14,"if programs were only meant to serve the poor and did so perfectly, coverage would be"
51,15,"insufficient, often by severalfold. In countries with significant flagship programs as in"
51,16,"Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, the poverty rate (US$1.90/day) is between 34 and 47 per-"
51,17,"cent; yet safety nets cover only 8–13 percent of the population.14 In countries such as"
51,18,"Madagascar or Sierra Leone, the disjuncture is much larger—in Sierra Leone, there are"
51,19,"more than 10 times as many poor people as those served by safety nets; and in Mad-"
51,20,"agascar, more than 20 times (Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve 2018). In other words,"
51,21,"low budgets may leave large swaths of people in need uncovered almost by design (e.g.,"
51,22,"via rationing). Therefore, it is expected that a program that, for example, allocates over"
51,23,"4 percent of GDP (Georgia’s old-age pension) displays better targeting outcomes than"
51,24,"a similar program costing nearly 66 times less, or 0.06 percent of GDP, such as India’s"
51,25,"IGNOAPS scheme (Kidd and Athias 2019)."
51,26,"         Two other factors that contribute to low coverage among social protection systems"
51,27,"are limited awareness and costs for participation. In order to be enrolled, people have to"
51,28,"know about the program, want to be enrolled, and have low enough transaction costs to"
51,29,"make it worthwhile. Barriers faced by the poor are numerous—lower literacy and con-"

52,3,"site identity (ID) documents, etc.—all of which can add up to significant undercoverage"
52,4,"among the poor even in a categorical, age-based program. For example, the simple"
52,5,"failure to identify the age of a person in 22 African countries caused social pension pro-"
52,6,"grams to not reach up to 30 percent of eligible elderly (Guven and Leite 2016)."
52,7,"       Social assistance programs have been increasingly diligent in tackling these issues"
52,8,"with a host of initiatives for active outreach. For example, in Brazil, an active outreach"
52,9,"strategy for the social registry was in initiated in 2011 with the tag line Conhecer para"
52,10,"Incluir (to know so as to include). Outreach was intense until 2014 and included media"
52,11,"outreach and door-to-door efforts in target areas from slums to jungles. About 1.5 million"
52,12,"new families were added to the national social registry used for 30 programs, principal"
52,13,"among them the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer (CCT). Of these families, over"
52,14,"a million were from traditional groups (e.g., indigenous or riverine populations) that are"
52,15,"highly vulnerable and often underserved. In Argentina as recently as 2016, 1.5 million"
52,16,"children were not receiving the universal child allowance principally because of issues"
52,17,"with either the children or their parents not having IDs or mismatches in the linkages"
52,18,"among them, or issues related to verifying children’s enrollment in schools.15"
52,19,"       At its early phases of introduction, a UBI would require scaling up outreach efforts"
52,20,"in a substantial way. It is not unlikely, however, that awareness about a UBI entitlement"
52,21,"would likely be widespread in a short period of time. The program may require significant"
52,22,"administrative effort around rollout, follow-up in perpetuity to keep pace with life-cycle"
52,23,"events, and possibly changes in citizenship or residency (see chapter 7). The intensity"
52,24,"of such administrative efforts would depend on institutional and delivery capacities, the"
52,25,"pace at which the UBI is introduced, and whether it is a new program or a substitute or"
52,26,"extension of other programs."
52,27,"       Overall, a UBI may have beneficial effects in drastically reducing the various proce-"
52,28,"dural and transaction costs beneficiaries incur when applying and waiting for eligibility"
52,29,"determination.16 The permanent and open nature of a UBI should help overcome barriers"
52,30,"related to information—even if they are not aware or willing in the first year, individu-"
52,31,"als initially not enrolled could gain information or confidence over time as others in"
52,32,"their social network begin to benefit. Similarly, a UBI should help eliminate enrollment"
52,33,"constraints based on stigma, suppositions that people might not meet eligibility require-"
52,34,"ments, or opportunity costs in participation."
52,35,"       A fourth factor around low coverage of the poor by social assistance is erroneous"
52,36,"eligibility determination. Program eligibility relies on detailed information, which can be"
52,37,"difficult to observe and is also ever-changing. There are in fact errors of exclusion due to"
52,38,"the nature of poverty measures and limited information (Alatas et al. 2012; Coady 2018;"
52,39,"IMF 2017; Kidd and Athias 2019; Premand and Schnitzer 2018). Needs-based targeted"
52,40,"programs also present challenges in terms of where to draw the eligibility threshold"
52,41,"(box 1.2). Taken in isolation, targeting methods can present severe challenges in contexts"
52,42,"with significant information constraints17 (Brown, Ravallion, and van de Walle 2018); yet"
52,43,"their performance can increase remarkably in higher-capacity contexts, as in the United"
52,44,"States (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 2018)."

53,22,"   The discussion is also related to an evolving understanding of poverty dynamics"
53,23,"   in developing countries. Even where poverty is less prevalent than in cases like"
53,24,"   Bangladesh, there can be a concentration of similarly vulnerable people around"
53,25,"   poverty lines. For instance, in some middle-income countries, those living on US$6/"
53,26,"   day, or just above the poverty line, face a 40 percent probability of falling back into"
53,27,"   poverty (Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez 2011). In fact, poverty is often dynamic: in"
53,28,"   Africa, one-third of the population is persistently poor, while another third moves"
53,29,"   in and out of poverty (Dang and Dalaban 2019). These issues suggest the need for"
53,30,"   predictable coverage that would protect both those in poverty and those at risk"
53,31,"   of it. The smooth distribution of poverty and the volatility of income imply that a"
53,32,"   policy that does not present sharp cliffs may be more appropriate, which some-"

53,34,"   poorest. These differential needs, however, could equally argue for a benefit struc-"

53,36,"   of equal transfers."

54,2,"Conditionality"
54,3,"The use of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) has grown remarkably and is now pres-"
54,4,"ent in at least 101 low- and middle-income countries. Yet a significant portion of social"
54,5,"protection programs are linked, more or less explicitly, to some form of reciprocity in"
54,6,"participant behaviors. And, as part of the rapid rise in cash transfer programs in the last"
54,7,"two decades, a significant share has conditions that require beneficiary households to"
54,8,"seek basic maternal-child health care and/or education for school-age children. Such"
54,9,"programs now exist in 63 countries worldwide.18 Conditionality is not just about child-re-"
54,10,"lated co-responsibilities, as poverty-targeted benefits are commonly tied to job search"
54,11,"requirements, training, or community service. In a way, even public works could be con-"
54,12,"sidered a form of conditionality."
54,13,"      The issue of co-responsibilities or conditionality raises a set of conceptual, practical,"
54,14,"and empirical matters that are worth reflecting on as they cast light on the acceptability"
54,15,"and impacts of the move to unconditionality implied in a UBI. We here review them in turn."
54,16,"      First the concepts. While virtually every society cares about its disadvantaged"
54,17,"members, such altruistic attitudes can translate into different preferences over welfare"
54,18,"regimes and, in turn, taxpayer utility functions (Currie and Gahvari 2008; Reinhardt"
54,19,"2013). For example, under one assumption taxpayers maximize their own utility when"
54,20,"the poor are allowed to maximize their own choice, such as by receiving unrestricted"
54,21,"support. Under other assumptions, taxpaying voters typically exhibit a more parental"
54,22,"form of altruism that would not necessarily favor support with “no strings attached”"
54,23,"(Tobin 1970).19 In other words, the preference among voters for bestowing on the poor"
54,24,"conditional or unconditional benefits may well reflect societal values, attitudes, culture,"
54,25,"and preferences toward redistribution."
54,26,"      These overarching philosophical and cultural considerations emerge in"
54,27,"policy debates, sometimes with no shortage of inflammatory rhetoric.20 Accord-"
54,28,"ing to some quarters, imposing conditions on poor households tends to evoke"
54,29,"the specter of structural adjustment (where macro conditions were part of policy"
54,30,"reform packages) or 19th century–style social assistance providing “punitive”"
54,31,"and minimal support. Freeland caricatures the “productivists” championing CCTs as"
54,32,"one of the “four horsemen of the donor apocalypse” determined to pursue an agenda"
54,33,"whereby “nobody should be given something for nothing” (Freeland 2013, 232). The"
54,34,"vision postulates that conditions are forced onto powerless people while depriving them"
54,35,"of their dignity."
54,36,"      On the other hand, there is a general understanding that societies are woven together"
54,37,"by a set of core rights and responsibilities, and that these would need to coexist in gen-"
54,38,"eral—for instance, “pay taxes, receive services” or “work hard, care for others, get help"
54,39,"when needed”—as well as in specific policies. These considerations might be less com-"
54,40,"pelling for social services, where the notion of unconditional health, education, or child"
54,41,"care provisions tends to resonate societally. Yet cash transfers engender a different philo-"
54,42,"sophical and political conversation, especially where, for historical antecedents and moral"
54,43,"principles, cash is interpreted as a reward stemming from effort, even if broadly defined."
54,44,
55,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                               31"
55,2,"       In some polities, the nature of the welfare discourse may be such that the polit-"
55,3,"ical viability of an intervention may hinge on embedding some form of beneficiary"
55,4,"co-responsibilities into the program’s design. The chief architect of Mexico’s national"
55,5,"CCT program Prospera recollects that co-responsibilities or conditions might “contrib-"
55,6,"ute to the acceptance of the cash transfer program by the general public, given that in"
55,7,"some countries a program that ‘just gives money’ to poor families may not be politically"
55,8,"acceptable” (Levy 2007, 125). From this perspective, the attachment of conditions may"
55,9,"well reflect realpolitik instead of adherence to ideological principles."
55,10,"       From an economic perspective, choices over conditionality generally revolve"
55,11,"around the notion of underprovision of goods. In broad terms, the theory suggests that"
55,12,"expected externalities of a conditional transfer would be desirable when there is a pri-"
55,13,"vate underinvestment—say, in nutrition or health—below an optimal social (or even"
55,14,"private) level. Conditions represent a vehicle to influence behaviors, especially when"
55,15,"people may not be well informed or may have inconsistent preferences over time, and"
55,16,"there are coordination failures. This is the case when there is a discrepancy between per-"
55,17,"ceived and expected returns, for example, to nutrition or education, which somewhat"
55,18,"challenges the assumption that “people always know best.” However, there could also be"
55,19,"unintended behavioral effects, such as reinforcing preexisting gender disparities (Buller"
55,20,"et al. 2018; Peterman et al. 2017)."
55,21,"       Practically speaking, a conditional transfer needs a certain institutional and adminis-"
55,22,"trative capacity for implementation. This includes both a well-functioning supply of services,"
55,23,"and a system for coordination and reconciliation of data across the sectors that are being"
55,24,"“conditioned to” under the program. This is why, for instance, PROGRESA was first tested"
55,25,"in more conducive urban areas, and then rolled out only where adequate services were"
55,26,"available. Simultaneously, for over a decade an unconditional arm of the program oper-"
55,27,"ated in areas poorly served by schools or clinics (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 2018)."
55,28,"       An implementation perspective also reveals that conditions are not a binary vari-"
55,29,"able but rather that conditionality exists on a “hard to define continuum” ranging from"
55,30,"informal to formal conditioning (Pellerano and Barca 2017), with the practice on condi-"
55,31,"tionality generally falling into three categories:"
55,32,"       •• “Labeled” CCTs, which use informal and nonbinding conditioning to link a"
55,33,"          scheme with certain behaviors, without explicitly requiring, monitoring, or"
55,34,"          enforcing any co-responsibility"
55,35,"       •• “Soft” CCTs, which envision formal conditions that are only gently enforced,"
55,36,"          meaning they are explicitly required and monitored to some degree, but penal-"
55,37,"          izing for noncompliance is light or nonexistent"
55,38,"       •• “Hard” CCTs, which display formal conditions that are routinely monitored and"
55,39,"          strictly enforced, with significant penalties for noncompliance"
55,40,"       Empirically, there is an emerging but still rather inconclusive body of evidence sug-"
55,41,"gesting that CCTs lead to mild increases in the use of required services (see box 1.3 and"
55,42,
56,1,"32                                            Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"

56,4,"   F  ive reviews of cash transfers’ impact on wide-ranging outcome areas conclude"
56,5,"      that CCTs can, under certain circumstances, have a higher impact than UCTs."
56,6,"      •• Analyzing cash transfers’ impact on education through 35 studies, Baird"
56,7,"         et al. (2014) conclude that both CCTs and UCTs improve school enrollment"
56,8,"         and attendance, with no significant difference between them. However,"
56,9,"         when categorizing transfers according to the strictness of conditionality, the"
56,10,"         researchers conclude that “hard” CCTs have substantively larger effects on"
56,11,"         enrollment and attendance than either UCTs or “soft” CCTs. But they also note"
56,12,"         that none of the programs significantly affect longer-term outcomes, mea-"
56,13,"         sured through improvements in test scores."
56,14,"      •• Focusing on cash transfers’ impact on the use and quality of maternity care"
56,15,"         services, Hunter et al. (2017) find only one published study exploring a UCT’s"
56,16,"         impact on maternity service uptake, in which no significant effect was iden-"
56,17,"         tified. By comparison, more frequently studied CCTs appear to increase the"
56,18,"         proportion of women receiving multiple antenatal checkups (a condition of"
56,19,"         the transfer). However, the CCT did not increase uptake of other maternity"
56,20,"         care services that were not included as conditions, highlighting the relatively"
56,21,"         narrow scope of CCT impact."
56,22,"      •• The potential—but narrow—impact of CCTs is also noted in the literature"
56,23,"         review undertaken by Taafe, Longosz, and Wilson (2016) on cash transfers’"
56,24,"         effects on livelihoods, education, and health. They conclude that condition-"
56,25,"         ality is not always necessary to produce an impact, but may lead to stronger"
56,26,"         effects. However, conditionality may limit outcomes to those linked to the"
56,27,"         conditions, whereas UCTs have the potential to generate more widespread"
56,28,"         impact across development objectives. Furthermore, conditionality requires"
56,29,"         significant administrative and financial resources that may not be feasible in"
56,30,"         lower-income contexts."
56,31,"      •• A rigorous, wide-ranging literature review by Bastagli et al. (2019) concludes"
56,32,"         that conditionality can improve the outcomes on which the transfer was con-"
56,33,"         ditioned, but argue that much of this impact may be achieved with the clear"
56,34,"         messaging and communication of informal or soft conditions, rather than the"
56,35,"         socially and administratively costly sanctions associated with hard CCTs."
56,36,"      •• This conclusion is more or less mirrored in a subsequent broad literature review"
56,37,"         by Pellerano and Barca (2017), which concludes that explicit conditional-"

57,5,"        among CCT participants over the longer term."
57,6,"  Two systematic reviews—both relating to health—conclude that UCTs either"
57,7,"  match or outperform CCTs."
57,8,"     •• Exploring cash transfers’ impact on nutrition, Manley, Gitter, and Slavchevska"
57,9,"        (2012) review 24 papers on 18 programs in 11 countries and find little difference"
57,10,"        between UCT and CCT impacts, with health and education–focused CCTs"
57,11,"        having the same effect on child height for age as UCTs. However, they note"
57,12,"        that CCTs with other types of conditions, mostly related to working or saving,"
57,13,"        show strongly negative impacts on nutritional status, revealing the potentially"
57,14,"        adverse secondary effects of conditionalities."
57,15,"     •• This resembles the findings of Siddiqi, Rajaram, and Miller (2018) in their sys-"
57,16,"        tematic review on the impact of cash transfers on newborns’ health. Looking"
57,17,"        at data from 14 studies, they find that both UCTs and health-focused CCTs"
57,18,"        tended to improve infants’ birthweight outcomes and reduce infant mortality,"
57,19,"        while CCTs conditioned on labor force participation had no impact."
57,20,"  Three systematic reviews—two on health and one on child labor—argue that the"
57,21,"  evidence is inconclusive in determining whether conditionality increases a cash"
57,22,"  transfer’s impact."
57,23,"     •• Considering cash transfers’ impact on child labor, de Hoop and Rosati (2014)"
57,24,"        conclude that both CCTs and UCTs reduce children’s participation in child"
57,25,"        labor and their hours worked, with more information needed to determine"
57,26,"        whether schooling conditions matter in this regard."
57,27,"     •• Looking at cash transfers’ impacts on contraception use, Khan et al. (2016)"
57,28,"        also conclude that the available evidence of CCT versus UCT effectiveness is"
57,29,"        inconclusive due to the limited number of studies, varying outcome measures,"
57,30,"        and lack of interventions specifically for contraception."
57,31,"     •• In a Cochrane review focused primarily on UCTs’ impact on health outcomes,"

57,33,"        service use but may still improve some health outcomes and health care"
57,34,"        expenditure levels. They consider the Burkina Faso, Malawi, and Zimbabwe"
57,35,"        randomized controlled trials comparing UCT and CCT impact on health and"
57,36,"        conclude that the evidence on the relative effectiveness of different types of"

58,2,"appendix C). Policy designers should be mindful that cash transfer programs produce"
58,3,"a vector of impacts starting with the use of required services, but also including effects"
58,4,"on consumption—especially of more and more nutritious food; and of improved mental"
58,5,"health, confidence, and empowerment—and sometimes on increased savings or invest-"
58,6,"ments in livelihoods, reduced migration, etc. If an individual or family is excluded from"
58,7,"benefits for lack of, for example, enrollment, then the family may be excluded from"
58,8,"these other benefits (not related to education). Empirics on the forgone impacts from"
58,9,"excluding noncompliant children or households are largely missing. Because penalties"
58,10,"for noncompliance in some CCT models are rather rarely exercised, we conjecture that"
58,11,"such lost potential impacts may be small, but are nonetheless worth considering in any"
58,12,"choice around conditioning."
58,13,"      To sum up, a UBI that renders support without conditions resembles many UCT"
58,14,"programs found in social assistance programming around the world. But the prevalence"
58,15,"of some sort of conditioning—even if only notional—suggests that the unconditional fea-"
58,16,"ture of a UBI will be challenging to present practice in at least some places. The empirical"
58,17,"evidence suggests that without conditions, there may be some mild reduction in service"
58,18,"uptake. However, sizable impacts seem to be achieved by programs with well-implemented"
58,19,"soft conditionalities, which are likely to be less administratively and cost demanding."
58,20,"Transfer Modality"
58,21,"Economics and Beyond"
58,22,"A survey of economists found that 84 percent of them agree with the statement that"
58,23,"“cash payments increase the welfare of recipients to a greater degree than do trans-"
58,24,"fers-in-kind of equal cash value” (Mankiw 2009). The result from the profession is not"
58,25,"surprising. In fact, standard economic theory predicts that, under certain assumptions,21"
58,26,"cash is more “utility maximizing” than in-kind transfers. This stems from the basic fea-"
58,27,"ture that cash is flexible and provides people with choice on how to spend it. Cash can"
58,28,"also accomplish broader goals, such as redefining the balance of power between govern-"
58,29,"ment and its citizens in favor of the latter. Yet there are also limitations, and this section"
58,30,"acknowledges that cash is not appropriate in all contexts."
58,31,"      Cash transfers have grown enormously in coverage and spreading across developing"
58,32,"countries. In Africa, over 2010–15, an average of 14 new safety net programs were intro-"
58,33,"duced annually, mostly cash based. Such growth could partly be explained by the solid"
58,34,"evidence base underpinning such programs. A number of myths on cash-based social"
58,35,"assistance have been dispelled by recent evaluation compilations: research has found that"
58,36,"cash transfers are overwhelmingly spent wisely or on desirable consumption or productive"
58,37,"goods (Evans and Popova 2017); the risks of labor supply disincentives have been largely"
58,38,"debunked (Baird, McKenzie, and Özler 2018; Banerjee et al. 2017); and cash transfers have"
58,39,"a range of impacts on critical dimensions for growth, such as cognitive development, accu-"
58,40,"mulation of human capital, asset protection, and fostering social cohesion (Bastagli et al."
58,41,"2018; Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve 2018). Cash can spark local economic multipliers,"
58,42,
59,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                             35"
59,2,"with recent evidence showing that for every dollar injected, between US$1.27 and US$2.52"
59,3,"is generated in the local economy (Handa et al. 2018). While there is ongoing debate on"
59,4,"specific research questions—such as the duration of effects over time (Blattman, Fiala, and"
59,5,"Martinez 2018)—the empirical track record of cash transfers is unrebuttably strong."
59,6,"       Compared to in-kind food, clothing, fertilizer, or school uniforms, moving cash"
59,7,"around to beneficiaries has always been much simpler. The procurement, storage, and"
59,8,"distribution problems for goods can be considerable. In contrast, cash is compact and"
59,9,"nonperishable. With the advent of transactions through the financial sector and mobile"
59,10,"money, e-cash payments can reduce certain types of security concerns. Even in human-"
59,11,"itarian crises, cash transfers are now delivered using electronic or even block-chain"
59,12,"technology, such as in support of refugees in Jordan. In fact, the savings in using cash"
59,13,"as a transfer modality can be substantial. Evidence shows that, in four studies that com-"
59,14,"pared equal value of transfers, between 13 and 23 percent additional households could"
59,15,"have been reached if food transfers were in cash instead (Gentilini 2016)."
59,16,"       At the same time, cash transfers are never implemented in isolation and coexist"
59,17,"with in-kind food programs. These reach about 1.5 billion people in low- and middle-in-"
59,18,"come countries (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 2018). Recent evidence is casting new"
59,19,"light on such decades-long experiences. Two main lessons stand out. First, the fact that a"
59,20,"program is food or cash based is not necessarily a determinant of performance in terms"
59,21,"of coverage, targeting accuracy, and a host of other dimensions. Indeed, some countries"
59,22,"that maintained an in-kind modality managed to improve its performance remarkably,"
59,23,"such as with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the United States"
59,24,"and the targeted Public Distribution System in select states in India. Yet, other countries"
59,25,"that initially maintained in-kind provisions, such as in Indonesia’s Rastra program, did"
59,26,"not improve their performance significantly (the Rastra program eventually transitioned"
59,27,"to vouchers). Other countries that commenced a transition to vouchers and cash transfers"
59,28,"were able to reap the benefits from such a conversion; this was the case for Mexico’s Pro-"
59,29,"grama de Apoyo Alimentario and, to some extent, the Arab Republic of Egypt’s schemes."
59,30,"For some countries, however, such as Sri Lanka, the change in modality did not translate"
59,31,"into enhanced program performance. What seems to drive improvements is not so much"
59,32,"the transfer modality, but factors such as political leadership at key junctures, credible"
59,33,"evidence, a judicious use of technology, appropriate delivery processes, and ways to hold"
59,34,"providers accountable (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 2018)."
59,35,"       Second, unlike cash transfers, food-based programs tend to pursue a variety of"
59,36,"intertwined functions. For example, they support farmers via procurement (agricul-"
59,37,"tural goal), they are leveraged to manage price fluctuations with strategic storage (risk"
59,38,"management goal), and they provide income support to low-income consumers (social"
59,39,"assistance goal). The role of cash is more streamlined, as it largely revolves solely around"
59,40,"the social assistance function. This multiplicity of objectives for food-based programs"
59,41,"means more stakeholders, a thornier political economy of reform, and likely higher"
59,42,"costs. But it also demands careful consideration of possible systemwide effects from a"
59,43,"complete replacement of in kind with cash as would occur with a UBI. This caution is"
59,44,"particularly compelling for the capacity of lower-income countries to handle food price"
59,45,
60,1,"36                                             Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
60,2,"volatility (i.e., in-kind provisions are often used as a way to protect against inflation), and"
60,3,"the possible alienation of political and financial support from key constituencies in all"
60,4,"country contexts."
60,5,"       Though the hypothesis that cash is an efficient and acceptable transfer modality"
60,6,"is strong, there are some limitations to its applicability and circumstances when in-kind"
60,7,"provision may be preferable. For instance, turning needs into effective demand is a key"
60,8,"rationale behind the microeconomics of cash transfers. But doing so might be challeng-"
60,9,"ing in the presence of weakly integrated or poorly competitive markets. In such contexts,"
60,10,"price transmissions would not necessarily signal relative scarcities, and localized cash"
60,11,"injections may result in price spikes—leaving other consumers and net buyers worse off."
60,12,"If there are circumstances where local markets may perform poorly, food prices may be"
60,13,"excessively high or volatile, and private traders may not supply commodities efficiently."
60,14,"In those contexts, a cash transfer may lead to neither more choice nor more purchas-"
60,15,"ing power, and in-kind food may be a more appropriate response (i.e., it ensures both"
60,16,"availability of and access to food). For example, in parts of Kenya, cash transfers did not"
60,17,"protect purchasing power in areas with dysfunctional markets, which affected nutrition"
60,18,"negatively (Dietrich and Schmerzeck 2019)."
60,19,"       Sound implementation is another factor shaping preferences. In India, it has been"
60,20,"documented that people’s preferences for cash or food depend “on a combination of"
60,21,"pragmatism, shrewdness and deep understanding of the local circumstances” (Khera"
60,22,"2014, 44). In particular, the study showed that preferences hinged on the implemen-"
60,23,"tation performance of the targeted public food distribution system. In states where"
60,24,"the system worked poorly, people preferred cash; where the existing food distribution"
60,25,"system worked well, larger shares of people preferred food."
60,26,"       Gender tends to be another key factor affecting preferences. In a number of soci-"
60,27,"eties, women tend to prefer food, which they are more likely to control, while men"
60,28,"may prefer cash transfers. Anecdotal evidence shows that the process of intrahouse-"
60,29,"hold decision making also counts (e.g., men and women deciding in concert how to use"
60,30,"household resources, even in contexts where women may be physically constrained in"
60,31,"reaching markets or face risks in accessing them, such as in refugee camps). Yet very"
60,32,"few studies, if any, are testing the differential impacts (e.g., on nutrition) of cash versus"
60,33,"food transfers as provided to men and women."
60,34,"       Qualitative research is shedding light on intra-community effects of cash transfers,"
60,35,"some of which are positive and empowering, while others may generate undesired con-"
60,36,"sequences in terms of social relations. In Zimbabwe it was observed that, unlike food,"
60,37,"cash transfers were not shared within the community, hence hindering informal mutual"
60,38,"support and risk management mechanisms among members, but reinforcing targeting"
60,39,"(MacAuslan and Riemenschneider 2011). The intra- and inter-community effects of alter-"
60,40,"native transfers is an issue that may deserve further qualitative and quantitative study."
60,41,"       One way in which in-kind transfers may have an advantage over cash is in terms"
60,42,"of nutrition, such as via micronutrient fortification (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov"
60,43,"2018). Only a few studies have documented the comparative impact of transfers on"
60,44,"nutrition in direct comparisons. In one of those, Langendorf et al. (2014) assessed several"
60,45,
61,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                               37"
61,2,"types of cash and food combinations, including a range of different high-quality foods"
61,3,"(e.g., lipid-based supplements and fortified cereals) as well as more traditional ones (veg-"
61,4,"etable oils, pulses). The intervention aimed at reducing severe and moderately acute"
61,5,"malnutrition as well as mortality rates among children. Findings showed that combining"
61,6,"food and cash transfers reduced the incidence of malnutrition at about twice the rate of"
61,7,"either a cash transfer or supplementary food alone."
61,8,"       Reviews of the evidence have thus shown that the impact of cash and in-kind"
61,9,"transfers on welfare (especially food security) varies by indicator, although they tend to"
61,10,"be similar on average. However, implementation costs tend to be lower for cash. In gen-"
61,11,"eral, the performance of transfers seems to reflect the interactions among a number of"
61,12,"factors such as the profile and initial conditions of beneficiaries, the functioning of local"
61,13,"markets, program objectives, and the implementation context (Gentilini 2016). Cash as"
61,14,"a transfer modality is applicable in many, though not all, contexts. In the design of UBI"
61,15,"proposals, the notion that benefits be paid in cash is not very radical and, while there"
61,16,"are unknowns (e.g., inflationary effects), it may be the least contested part of a proposal."
61,17,"Inflation"
61,18,"Possible inflationary risks are one of the most debated possible effects of a UBI, and a"
61,19,"central concern of low-income individuals. Such risks should not be easily dismissed a"
61,20,"priori, nor should they be overly magnified. Instead, they should be assessed within the"
61,21,"framework of analytical parameters, contextual factors, and relevant experiences."
61,22,"       What practical experiences can inform the discussion on such effects? In the case"
61,23,"of large-scale, one-off transfers in high-income countries, there is no evidence of infla-"
61,24,"tion. For example, in January 2011, Kuwait announced an Amiri grant of US$3,600 to"
61,25,"be paid to all 1.1 million Kuwaitis on February 24 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of"
61,26,"independence.22 Monthly data on the consumer price index reveals no significant dis-"
61,27,"continuity in price values around the time of the transfer announcement and payment."
61,28,"       Similarly, in 2008 and 2009, the government of Australia delivered a fiscal stimulus"
61,29,"package with various cash bonus schemes.23 One-off cash payments were made to about"
61,30,"90 percent of households and 80 percent of working-age individuals, with the average"
61,31,"bonus amounting to $A 1,600 (Hyslop 2014). This represented around 4–5 percent of"
61,32,"individual income, and the cash bonuses collectively accounted for nearly 2 percent"
61,33,"of GDP. Again, consumer price index analysis reveals no discernible effect on inflation"
61,34,"attributable to the bonus. Yet these findings cannot rule out more localized cases of price"
61,35,"increases in both countries."
61,36,"       One possible reason for limited inflation in high-income countries is that markets"
61,37,"tend to be more integrated than in low- and middle-income contexts. This is a salient"
61,38,"issue: if the relevant market receiving cash is mainly local, isolated, and weakly integrated"
61,39,"into the wider economy, then effects may differ. The presence of oligopolistic producers"
61,40,"or, if the local market is competitive, a rising marginal cost of local production will likely"
61,41,"translate the demand from cash transfers into higher prices. In turn, transaction costs"
61,42,"in reaching such areas may offset the potential attractiveness of serving such high-price"
61,43,
62,1,"38                                            Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
62,2,"markets by other suppliers. The classic literature on famines, for instance, provides ample"
62,3,"analytical treatment of such mechanisms starting from the 1980s (Drèze and Sen 1989;"
62,4,"Devereux 1988; Ravallion 1997). Instead, if markets are well integrated, more competition"
62,5,"among suppliers to meet the cash-induced demand may likely result in no or little inflation."
62,6,"       Recent evidence from Mexico illustrates these arguments. Experimental work on"
62,7,"the price effects on cash and in-kind transfers suggests that “for typical transfer pro-"
62,8,"grams, price effects may not be economically significant in many communities” (Cunha,"
62,9,"De Giorgi, and Jayachandran 2017, 3). However, in less developed Mexican villages,"
62,10,"in-kind transfers decreased the price of select commodities (those provided as part of"
62,11,"the food basket) by 5 percentage points; cash transfers in similarly remote areas led to"
62,12,"mild increases (1.5 percent) in overall food prices."
62,13,"       The intensity of the cash injection matters as well. In the Philippines, in remote areas"
62,14,"where the provision of cash transfers was significant (i.e., where village income increased"
62,15,"on the order of 9 percent), the price of nontradable, perishable protein-rich foods increased"
62,16,"by 6–8 percent (Filmer et al. 2018). Such an effect generated unintended impacts on the"
62,17,"nutritional levels of nonbeneficiary children (whose stunting rates rose by 11 percentage"
62,18,"points) with inflationary effects persisting 31 months after the program’s introduction."
62,19,"       Similar mechanisms can be at play in other markets, including health care. For"
62,20,"example, evidence from Indonesia shows that cash transfers increased the demand for"
62,21,"health services by beneficiaries, but crowded out health utilization by nonbeneficiaries"
62,22,"(Triyana 2016). In fact, the demand generated by cash transfers led to higher health costs"
62,23,"due to the limited supply of trained health providers. This inhibited access to health by"
62,24,"poor nonparticipants. These effects may not occur where the supply side of services is"
62,25,"less constrained, as in Thailand."
62,26,"       In other large-scale experiences, such as in Alaska, no studies have yet tested"
62,27,"impacts on inflation empirically.24 In Mongolia, some minor inflation was detected,"
62,28,"although it is poorly documented (Yeung and Howes 2015); and in the Islamic Republic"
62,29,"of Iran, the UBI scheme was itself implemented in a highly inflationary context—a factor"
62,30,"that wiped out three-quarters of the program’s real value between 2012 and 2018."
62,31,"       Index-linking cash benefits to inflation can help, but above certain thresholds it"
62,32,"becomes more effective to provide in-kind transfers. The presence of basis risk could"
62,33,"hinder the effectiveness of index linking (i.e., the inability of programs to detect localized"
62,34,"price spikes), and poor people often do not trust policy makers in doing so (Drèze 2017)."
62,35,"       In sum, our analytical toolbox and recent experiences show that possible effects on"
62,36,"inflation, and their intensity, are not predetermined in the abstract. Instead, they would"
62,37,"likely hinge on overall market conditions, the specific market for subproducts and ser-"
62,38,"vices, the size of the program, and probably the duration of the intervention."
62,39,"Choices on Other Parameters"
62,40,"The three core choices of universality, unconditionality, and cash as transfer modality"
62,41,"define a UBI, but there are variations possible in the setting of other parameters—the level"
62,42,"and frequency of benefits, the inclusion of children or devising the program for adults"
62,43,
63,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                                               39"
63,2,"only, the inclusion of citizens or residents. These design dimensions should be considered"
63,3,"in tandem with factors discussed in other chapters, such as how the program is financed,"
63,4,"what programs are being replaced and related distributional effects (chapters 4 and 5),"
63,5,"specific political economy dynamics (chapter 6), and delivery capabilities (chapter 7). It is"
63,6,"their holistic consideration that will help illuminate how a UBI would fare in a given context."
63,7,"Level"
63,8,"The classic UBI proposal is to give an equal benefit to all. It is indeed worth reflecting"
63,9,"on the implications of the equal amount benefit structure. For some social goods, equal"
63,10,"treatment or inputs is clearly what is desirable. In a democracy, everyone should have"
63,11,"one vote. For other social goods, societies may pursue equality-related outcomes, which"
63,12,"may require unequal inputs (Devereux 2016). For example, governments may want to"
63,13,"have children able to read by the end of the second grade. This may take basic education"
63,14,"for all, plus more intensive instruction for children with learning disabilities. Similarly,"
63,15,"for everyone to live a healthy life to age 60, it may require giving those with diabetes or"
63,16,"asthma more intensive health care than others. So, if social policy aims to ensure ade-"
63,17,"quate living standards for all, provision should acknowledge that the most disadvantaged"
63,18,"would be further behind and would thus need more, not equal, support. Such differenti-"
63,19,"ated provision or prioritization implies the need for targeting, which is one of the reasons"
63,20,"why most countries’ social protection systems include at least some programs that focus"
63,21,"on the poor. (However, as we discuss in this chapter, this becomes a slightly more con-"
63,22,"tentious issue when a program focuses on the poor only.)"
63,23,"        In principle, these considerations do not rule out a UBI, but they do emphasize the"
63,24,"need to complement it with other more tailored interventions for those worse off. Pro-"
63,25,"viding such augmented provisions within a vision of universality seems in line with the"
63,26,"spirit of the social protection floor, as well as the experience of universal health cover-"
63,27,"age with progressive universalism (Cotlear et al. 2015; Gentilini 2018; Gwatkin and Ergo"
63,28,"2011; Jamison et al. 2013; Marmot Review 2010)."
63,29,"        The considerations around transfer levels should be aligned with the core ratio-"
63,30,"nale for a UBI, or its objectives (table 1.3). These can vary significantly, and we explore"
63,31,"such diverse narratives later in this chapter. As is further discussed in chapter 4, setting"
63,32,"the benefit level of UBI would need to be determined based on its goals as well as syn-"
63,33,"chronized within the broader design and financial and political trade-offs (Arnold 2018;"
63,34,"Francese and Prady 2018)."

64,2,"Frequency"
64,3,"In general, the default option for payment frequency is monthly (or as close to this as"
64,4,"transaction costs in the payment system make practical). Such a schedule is consistent"
64,5,"with helping people to meet their daily needs for food, shelter, and other necessities. But"
64,6,"a few policy proposals set out a UBI with a different distribution frequency. As we discuss"
64,7,"below, Alaska distributes annual transfers from its natural resource revenues, with the"
64,8,"frequency matching the purpose—distribution of dividends rather than equity or con-"
64,9,"sumption smoothing—and for a relatively small total amount (Marinescu 2018).25"
64,10,"       The decision around frequency of transfers is important because it can affect"
64,11,"spending patterns. Daidone et al. (2019) review a compilation of evidence from seven"
64,12,"African countries and observe that, when transfers are more lumpy and less frequent,"
64,13,"they are more likely to be invested in productive assets. Similarly, evidence from Sri"
64,14,"Lanka (Gentilini 2016) indicates that when transfers are less predictable and frequent,"
64,15,"they are more likely to be treated as “income windfalls” by beneficiaries, and hence used"
64,16,"for nontraditional investments (e.g., to buy higher-quality foods). However, in Nigeria,"
64,17,"receiving chunkier, less-frequent transfers made no substantial difference in the pro-"
64,18,"portion of cash held by women and in the overall positive impact on household living"
64,19,"conditions (Bastian, Goldstein, and Papineni 2017)."
64,20,"Children and Adults"
64,21,"Some variants of UBI proposals, especially those posited as responses to automation-in-"
64,22,"duced employment or wage losses, include only adults or working-age adults, meaning,"
64,23,"the “to all” is limited by age. The UBI simulations by Browne and Immervoll (2017) are"
64,24,"designed in this way, as was the pilot program in Namibia. Most of the proposals listed in"
64,25,"appendix B are for adults. Since a large share of current social assistance programming"
64,26,"is focused on children, this may mean that households with children may be worse off"
64,27,"under a UBI proposal than under current programming—unless a UBI is also provided to"
64,28,"children in full or in part. Comparisons depend on the specifics of the proposal and how"
64,29,"it would substitute for, or add to, existing programming (see chapter 4). But it is clear"
64,30,"that the choice of a UBI’s demographic composition would have significant bearing on"
64,31,"its fiscal envelope. For instance, in low-income countries, cost estimates for a UBI for the"
64,32,"full population versus variants for partial coverage of children or of adults only can vary"
64,33,"by about 10 percentage points of GDP (figure 1.2)."
64,34,"Residents and Citizens"
64,35,"Whether the concept of universality pertains to residents or citizens is a fraught issue."
64,36,"A human rights or philosophical motivation would suggest that benefits should go to"
64,37,"all people living in a territory regardless of legal status. But the distribution of cash"
64,38,"transfers has long evoked fears of welfare migration—attracting people from other areas"
64,39,"both within federal countries with decentralized welfare programs and from outside"
64,40,"national borders. While the evidence shows that the impact of transfers on mobility"

65,26,"           BOX 1.4 Do Cash Transfers Affect Mobility?"
65,27,"           A      global review of practices shows that social assistance programs can be clas-"
65,28,"                  sified in three clusters: (1) social assistance that implicitly deters migration,"
65,29,"           centering on place-based programs; (2) social assistance that implicitly facilitates"
65,30,"           migration by relaxing liquidity constraints and reducing transaction costs; and"
65,31,"           (3) social assistance that is explicitly conditioned on spatial mobility. The research"
65,32,"           finds that impacts on migration generally align with the implicit or explicit goals of"
65,33,"           interventions. Under cluster 1, the likelihood of moving declined between 0.22 and"
65,34,"           11.0 percentage points; among schemes in clusters 2 and 3, the probability to move"
65,35,"           soared between 0.32–25 and 20–55 percentage points, respectively. The analy-"
65,36,"           sis also reports spillover effects within households and communities. While social"
65,37,"           assistance seems not to determine migration decisions per se, it nonetheless enters"
65,38,"           the broader calculus of mobility decision making. As such, social protection can be"
65,39,"           an important part of public policy packages to manage mobility. More research is"
65,40,"           needed to better understand the role of social protection in structural transforma-"
65,41,"           tion—a process underpinned by domestic mobility and one whose performance"
65,42,"           may ultimately affect international migration."

66,3,"there are exceptions—for example, Atkinson’s “participation income” would include res-"
66,4,"idents26 (Atkinson 2015). The citizenship criteria presumably minimizes the impetus to"
66,5,"migration while also circumventing the thorny issue of residency, which can be a com-"
66,6,"plex challenge in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries (Gentilini"
66,7,"2015), but may also generate societal tensions."
66,8,"Individuals"
66,9,"The change in focus from household to individual has a number of implications. Giving"
66,10,"individual and equal benefits means that large households will receive larger payments"
66,11,"in proportion to their size. This benefit structure is intuitively obvious—every person"
66,12,"needs to eat, to be clothed and educated, etc. But, in fact, social protection programs are"
66,13,"rife with benefit structures that do not increase linearly with family size. There are some-"
66,14,"times economies of scale factored into costs of living, which is a reasonable conception"
66,15,"but full of empirical unknowns and variations and thus prone to dispute. There are often"
66,16,"limits to the number of children for which benefits will be paid, and sometimes there"
66,17,"are flat benefits per household irrespective of size, often for (largely unfounded) fear"
66,18,"that benefits will increase fertility. Further, by giving benefits to individuals rather than"
66,19,"households, one of the more challenging features of administering household-based pro-"
66,20,"grams—tracking who belongs to what household and the concomitant IDs involved—is"
66,21,"simplified. The system of individual IDs is sufficient to support a UBI, without build-"
66,22,"ing a system for linking and updating household IDs and their memberships; minors,"
66,23,"however, will still need to be linked to an adult. A focus on individuals may also help in"
66,24,"making programs more portable, that is, able to follow people independently of where"
66,25,"they live (box 1.4). This could be an important consideration in providing benefits to sea-"
66,26,"sonal migrants and other mobile urban dwellers (Gentilini 2015)."
66,27,"       A focus on individuals may also have effects within households, though there is a"
66,28,"dearth of evidence as to their magnitude. One line of thought is that by giving benefits to"
66,29,"all—including those with traditionally weak bargaining positions within households or com-"
66,30,"munities, such as people with disabilities or the elderly—it may be empowering. In theory,"
66,31,"the provision of cash to all individuals in a family, as opposed to selective provision to some"
66,32,"members and not others, may reduce tensions stemming from competing over scarce"
66,33,"resources. Just as current cash transfer programs may often reduce intimate partner and"
66,34,"emotional violence within the household relative to nonrecipients (Buller et al. 2018; Peter-"
66,35,"man et al. 2017), the provision of cash to all members may further attenuate those tensions."
66,36,"       Another view is that making all household members beneficiaries may affect"
66,37,"household composition and size. Households form and persist on the basis of affec-"
66,38,"tion and social norms, efficiency in task sharing, and resource pooling. By giving each"
66,39,"individual an autonomous income that does not depend on the unit in which he or she"
66,40,"lives, a UBI theoretically gives every individual more choice about their household mem-"
66,41,"bership—though the magnitude of the effect may be small relative to the other factors"
66,42,"that drive household formation. The valuation of the effect may be viewed by different"

67,5,"Phase-In Modality"
67,6,"The way a UBI is introduced matters. For example, it could be phased in by replacing"
67,7,"existing schemes, be provided on top of them, or a blend of both. Figure 1.3 illustrates"
67,8,"those modalities. The first option, presented as figure 1.3a, embodies the standard"
67,9,"approach to UBI. This approach would be relatively complex given the choices on what"
67,10,"programs would be replaced by a UBI—or how far the process of replacement should"
67,11,"go. The second, top-up, modality (figure 1.3b) would likely be simpler to devise, but also"
67,12,"more expensive. The third option, which reflects the Yang (2018) model in the United"
67,13,"States, involves providing a choice to people on whether to opt for a UBI in lieu of current"
67,14,"benefits received, or keep current programs if they provide higher benefits. As shown"
67,15,"in figure 1.3c, this proposal seeks to contain costs while enhancing the performance of"
67,16,"public welfare agencies via a market-based mechanism. Beneficiaries would become cli-"
67,17,"ents with an actual choice of either retaining services, or replacing them with a check.27"

67,24,"Three Stylized Narratives on UBI"
67,25,"Social Protection"
67,26,"There is much to celebrate in social protection in recent decades. The remarkable surge in"
67,27,"social assistance programming and the accompanying body of impact evaluations docu-"
67,28,"ment the significant and diverse impacts that well-designed and -executed programs can"
67,29,"have. There is a dramatic advance in the mechanics of implementation and increased"
67,30,"ambition for modernity—with e-IDs, e-payments, and dynamic and extensive social reg-"
67,31,"istries connecting clients with multiple programs. There are growing ambitions to improve"
67,32,"the earnings of the poor with either productive inclusion programs or activation measures"
67,33,
68,1,"44                                            Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
68,2,"(Veras Soares and Orton 2017). Some contributory pensions have been reformed to"
68,3,"improve their sustainability and equity, and a wave of social pensions is complementing"
68,4,"them to cover the informal sector. There are many challenges to individual programs or"
68,5,"countries that are still working to achieve good practice in one or more dimensions of"
68,6,"their delivery systems or programming. But two challenges pervade social protection for"
68,7,"which UBI is proposed as a solution: coverage gaps and fragmentation."
68,8,"       In terms of coverage, one starting point for analysis is the legislative architecture"
68,9,"or the rights agenda. For instance, under Sustainable Development Goal 1.3, signatories"
68,10,"are committed to “implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and mea-"
68,11,"sures for all, including floors.” Similarly, the Social Protection Floor initiative endorsed"
68,12,"by the UN Chief Executives Board in 2009 calls for an integrated set of social policies to"
68,13,"provide basic income security and access to essential social services for all, paying par-"
68,14,"ticular attention to vulnerable groups.28"
68,15,"       Universal social protection coverage can be achieved via multiple pathways. A com-"
68,16,"bination of contributory and noncontributory schemes could lead to a universal social"
68,17,"protection system. It could be pursued via the combination of different programs within"
68,18,"the same class of interventions, as with multiple social assistance programs. Or it could"
68,19,"be realized via a single program within the social assistance family, which is the case"
68,20,"of UBI. As to this last, however, as explained above, whether a flat transfer provides"
68,21,"adequate social protection against different shocks or states of being (poverty, unem-"
68,22,"ployment, illness, disability, old age) and is thereby an effective instrument to deliver the"
68,23,"economics right referred to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (box 1.5) is a"
68,24,"matter open to question."
68,25,"       But are the concepts of UBI and Social Protection Floors compatible? A floor, as"
68,26,"defined by International Labour Organization Recommendation No. 202, guarantees at"
68,27,"least a basic level of income security and access to essential health care.29 In principle,"
68,28,"this is not at odds with a UBI. As Ortiz et al. (2018, 5) put it, “a UBI would be the most"
68,29,"radical form of the income component of a social protection floor.” Whether a UBI is"
68,30,"compatible with the objectives of the floor or not depends on how its design is aligned"
68,31,"with the principles of Recommendation 202: if a UBI is designed to wholly replace most"
68,32,"of the welfare system, including programs and services for special needs, etc., then it is"
68,33,"clearly in contradiction with the floors. However, when a UBI is meant to strengthen and"
68,34,"enhance the progressive provision of social protection, then the floors and UBI concepts"
68,35,"are aligned. Such alignment occurs, for example, when a UBI is set at a benefit level to"
68,36,"ensure at least a basic level of income security, complementary social assistance benefits"
68,37,"are preserved for those with special needs, and financing is additional and nonregressive."
68,38,"       The political economy of social protection is another hotly debated issue. Universal"
68,39,"provisions, some argue, could help reach the “missing middle” and reactivate alliances"
68,40,"between the poor and the middle class for demanding broad-based social protection that"
68,41,"is politically sustainable30 (Desai and Kharas 2017). Some countries may present a trun-"
68,42,"cated welfare redistribution that is stronger at the extremes: the poorest of the poor may"
68,43,"be the primary beneficiaries of social assistance, while the upper deciles of the distribu-"
68,44,"tion would be sufficiently affluent to afford formal social insurance. In the middle there"

69,2,"    BOX 1.5 Rights Architecture and Select Legislative Provisions"
69,3,"    S   ocial protection is core to the human rights architecture. Article 22 of the Uni-"
69,4,"        versal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 firmly states that “everyone, as a"
69,5,"    member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization,"
69,6,"    through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with"
69,7,"    the organization and resources of each state, of the economic, social and cultural"
69,8,"    rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.”"
69,9,"    Article 23 envisions that “everyone who works has the right to just and favourable"
69,10,"    remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human"
69,11,"    dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.” And,"
69,12,"    according to Article 25, “motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care"
69,13,"    and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the"
69,14,"    same social protection.”"
69,15,"    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors implemen-"
69,16,"    tation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, has"
69,17,"    progressively developed the content of the right to social protection. Under Article 9,"
69,18,"    states have an underlying obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill, meaning that they"
69,19,"    must (1) refrain from interfering with or curtailing the enjoyment of the human right"
69,20,"    to social security, (2) protect individuals and groups against human rights abuses,"
69,21,"    and (3) take positive action to facilitate the enjoyment of social security. General"
69,22,"    Comment 19 asserts the need for sustainable social security systems enshrined in"
69,23,"    law, as well as obliges states to provide adequate and accessible services in a non-"
69,24,"    discriminatory manner. And the Optional Protocol, which entered into force in 2013,"
69,25,"    allows complaints to be received in case of violations of the rights enshrined in the"
69,26,"    covenant, including violations of the right to social security, which will contribute to"

69,34,"constitute about 60 percent of the population in developing countries (Birdsall 2018)."
69,35,"       UBI is often posited as a vehicle to reimagine public bureaucracies by consolidating"
69,36,"the plethora of social assistance programs and streamlining their administration. Indeed,"
69,37,"it is hard to imagine financing a UBI without repurposing budgets from some existing"
69,38,"programs. But which ones should be replaced? Why? How far should substitution go?"
69,39,"Envisioning a UBI replacing programs other than those providing pure income support"
69,40,
70,1,"46                                              Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
70,2,"is a much more radical rethinking of public policy than shifting money around between"
70,3,"a UBI, a child allowance, or a poverty-targeted transfer. Would a UBI-inspired reform pro-"
70,4,"cess replace disability assistance? All types of pensions? Would policy makers entertain"
70,5,"the possibility of cutting down social services? What about social workers who provide"
70,6,"counseling for substance addictions? Health or education services?"
70,7,"       Clearly, these questions are as technical as political or ideological. As mentioned"
70,8,"earlier in the chapter, a UBI is equally touted as a mechanism to expand the state (Van"
70,9,"Parijs and Vanderborght 2017) or erode it (Murray 2016). Hence, the process of pro-"
70,10,"gram substitution is the technical manifestation of normative principles—it can to some"
70,11,"extent reveal the true nature, purpose, and direction of reforms."
70,12,"       At present, social assistance nearly everywhere consists of a large number of individ-"
70,13,"ual programs. Data from some individual country inventories show astounding numbers"
70,14,"of programs. The World Bank Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity"
70,15,"(ASPIRE) database, which is not set up to capture such detail and focuses on the larger pro-"
70,16,"grams in each subclass, shows an average of 21.4 social assistance programs per country,"
70,17,"with Chile, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan having 143, 54, and 37 programs, respectively."
70,18,"       There are several reasons countries have a multiplicity of social protection pro-"
70,19,"grams. One reason is to address different goals—poverty prevention, income smoothing,"
70,20,"risk pooling, formation of human capital, increasing labor incomes, etc. Another is to"
70,21,"tailor (possibly similar) services to specific groups—for example, programs to improve"
70,22,"employment outcomes may focus on youth transitioning to work, the long-term unem-"
70,23,"ployed, older workers, migrants, or high-risk youth. In those cases, fragmentation could"
70,24,"well be diversification: different measures are intended for specific goals and vulnerabil-"
70,25,"ities, thus conceptually justifying them as separate programs."
70,26,"       The number of programs per se may not be an adequate indicator of inefficiency so"
70,27,"long as interventions complement each other in weaving a coherent portfolio of programs"
70,28,"(e.g., by addressing vulnerabilities throughout the life cycle) and are administratively"
70,29,"coordinated. Well-connected and -articulated programs may provide a comprehensive"
70,30,"system, with wrap-around care for individuals or families with multiple or complex chal-"
70,31,"lenges. As discussed in chapter 7, technology and administrative innovations are helping"
70,32,"connect different parts of the system in ways that make it more coherent and unified,"
70,33,"especially in contexts of high programmatic fragmentation (Barca 2017; Leite et al. 2017;"
70,34,"Lindert, George, and Rodriguez-Caillava, forthcoming)."
70,35,"       However, in many cases, programs may have grown in an uncoordinated manner"
70,36,"due to institutional or historical forces not principally aimed at efficient provision of coor-"
70,37,"dinated bundles of goods and services. Rather, before a national flagship cash transfer"
70,38,"program was developed, individual agencies may have developed one or more sector-spe-"
70,39,"cific programs of scholarships, fee waivers, and the like to prevent the poor from missing"
70,40,"that sector’s services. Similarly, different levels of government may have multiple programs."
70,41,"This is often noted in urban areas, where national, regional, and municipal programs may"
70,42,"overlap in the same block (Gentilini 2015). New governments or protagonists within them"
70,43,"may have launched successive initiatives in addition to, rather than as a substitute for,"
70,44,"what came before. These forces can truly fragment financing, result in either duplicative"

71,2,"administrative structures or programs run with insufficiently developed administrative"
71,3,"structures, and create a bewildering set of programs for both governments and beneficia-"
71,4,"ries to navigate—raising transaction costs and possibly discouraging participation."
71,5,"       Few countries have as rich a history of debating a UBI as India. The conversation"
71,6,"is a natural extension of the long-standing cash versus in-kind dilemma, including if and"
71,7,"how the food-based Public Distribution System, which is nearly universal,31 should be"
71,8,"replaced by cash transfers. The UBI debate is largely a reincarnation of that decades-old"
71,9,"quandary but is also fed by concerns over fragmentation. We here briefly chronicle the"
71,10,"main views and issues emerging from the debate. In addition to recent proposals for a"
71,11,"guaranteed minimum income laid out as part of the 2019 electoral campaign, concrete"
71,12,"proposals have emerged from Bardhan (2017) and Joshi (2016). Other prominent econ-"
71,13,"omists to express support for a UBI include Banerjee (2016), Ghatak (2016), and Ray"
71,14,"(2016). Box 1.6 sets out some of the emerging policy proposals."
71,15,"       While there is great diversity in the range of UBI proposals, so too is there wide-rang-"
71,16,"ing opposition to the idea of an Indian UBI. Aiyar (2017) maintains that a UBI could lead"
71,17,"people to “sit at home and play video games” or “get involved in undesirable activities,”"
71,18,"“create incentives for having more babies,” and “attract millions of immigrants from"
71,19,"Bangladesh and Nepal, mostly illegal.” Drèze (2017) cautions against a UBI based on"
71,20,"inflation, the multiplicity of objectives pursued by in-kind transfers, and delivery dimen-"
71,21,"sions (we return to some of these issues later in this chapter). For example, Drèze cites"
71,22,"the “sobering experience” of delayed and failed cash transfers in the context of National"
71,23,"Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) wage payments and Public Distribution"
71,24,"System cash transfer experiments. Ghosh (2017) fears that a UBI will erode the welfare"
71,25,"state by “moving out of essential public service delivery, essentially reneging on its con-"
71,26,"stitutional obligation to ensure the social and economic rights of citizens.”"
71,27,"       UBI skeptics argue that there are many more urgent claims for government spending"
71,28,"than a UBI program. Aiyar (2017) claims that “the cure to poverty lies in improving state"
71,29,"capacity and public goods.” Opponents also contend that these more valuable government"
71,30,"projects will be threatened by a UBI because the proposed financing mechanisms outlined"
71,31,"in the current set of UBI proposals are neither fiscally nor politically feasible.32 Even if the"
71,32,"fiscal calculations for UBI added up on paper, many contend that the political economy"
71,33,"makes the proposed savings unachievable in practice (Khera 2016). Removing subsidies"
71,34,"from the middle and upper classes is notoriously difficult to achieve, to the point that the"
71,35,"Economic Survey (see box 1.6) virtually discounts this as a viable option (Khosla 2018)."
71,36,"Chapter 6 presents more detail on the political economy dimensions of a UBI."
71,37,"Automation and Labor Market Disruptions"
71,38,"The narrative around labor markets includes three main subdebates: automation, stag-"
71,39,"nant and low wages, and the changing (or unchanging) nature of work. We here review"
71,40,"all three briefly, noting first that because these proposals are most linked to diminished"
71,41,"optimism that workers can earn sufficient independent incomes, they often focus bene-"

72,2,"   BOX 1.6 UBI Proposals in India"
72,3,"   T  hree UBI (or quasi-UBI) proposals have been detailed for the Indian context."
72,4,"      These proposals differ substantially in how they envision a UBI would be imple-"
72,5,"   mented in terms of the size of the proposed benefit, the estimated program cost,"
72,6,"   and the intended sources of financing."
72,7,"     •• The Finance Ministry’s Economic Survey 2016–17. The survey (Government of"
72,8,"        India 2017) recommends providing 75 percent of the population with monthly"
72,9,"        transfers amounting to Rs 7,620 (US$120) per person per year. At an estimated"
72,10,"        cost of 4.9 percent of GDP, the survey acknowledges that the quasi-UBI scheme"
72,11,"        would be “fiscally unaffordable” unless it replaced some existing welfare pro-"
72,12,"        grams, but stops short of recommending which programs to cut. A gradualist"
72,13,"        approach of phased implementation is recommended, starting with partic-"
72,14,"        ular target populations such as women, vulnerable groups, or urban areas."
72,15,"        Even with this tentative strategy, the survey recognizes that many adminis-"
72,16,"        trative, political, and financial challenges remain, concluding that “UBI is a"
72,17,"        powerful idea whose time even if not ripe for implementation is ripe for serious"
72,18,"        discussion.” A similar proposal by Felman et al. (2019), limited to rural popula-"
72,19,"        tions, calls for the provision of Rs 18,000 per year."
72,20,"     •• Bardhan proposal. An early advocate of an Indian UBI, Berkeley econo-"
72,21,"        mist Pranab Bardhan first proposed a UBI in 2011, and has since updated his"
72,22,"        proposal with revised figures (Bardhan 2017). He proposes a truly universal pro-"
72,23,"        gram and advocates more generous entitlements than does the Economic"
72,24,"        Survey, amounting to Rs 10,000 per person per year (indexed to inflation). He"
72,25,"        believes an effective UBI could be delivered alongside increases in health,"
72,26,"        education, and infrastructure expenditure without replacing existing social"
72,27,"        programs, such as the Public Distribution System and the National Rural"
72,28,"        Employment Guarantee Scheme. Rather, 10 percent of GDP would need to be"
72,29,"        reclaimed from other sources. Bardhan argues that this fiscal space could be"
72,30,"        created by (1) eliminating “nonmerit” fuel, fertilizer, water, electricity, and rail"
72,31,"        subsidies, which he estimates as costing 5 percent of GDP; (2) cutting certain"
72,32,"        forgone revenues, mainly corporate tax holidays and exemptions, to release"
72,33,"        around 2 percent of GDP; and (3) raising what he terms “absurdly” low or non-"
72,34,"        existent areas of taxation (such as real estate, long-term capital gains, and"
72,35,"        inheritance) to counter rising inequality."
72,36,"     •• Joshi proposal. Relative to the Bardhan and Economic Survey proposals, that"
72,37,"        of Oxford economist Vijay Joshi (2016) is far more conservative, proposing a"

73,5,"          and the poverty line threshold. This would amount to Rs 3,500 per person per"
73,6,"          year, at a fiscal cost of 3.5 percent of GDP. Joshi argues that this could be"
73,7,"          paid for through a broad set of fiscal reforms. Specifically, he estimates that"
73,8,"          10 percent of GDP would be freed up by eliminating inefficient price subsidies"
73,9,"          (including Public Distribution System food subsidies), cutting unproductive tax"
73,10,"          exemptions, taxing high agricultural incomes, and pursuing more vigorous pri-"
73,11,"          vatization programs. Joshi acknowledges the political economy challenges of"
73,12,"          his proposed fiscal reforms, but notes that such challenges are a poor reason"
73,13,"          to abandon the policy altogether."
73,14,"   A number of other economists have offered UBI recommendations for India as"
73,15,"   well. Ghatak (2016) and Banerjee (2016) have argued for UBI benefits of around"
73,16,"   Rs 13,000 per person per year, stressing the need for basic income benefits to equal"
73,17,"   the Tendulkar poverty line threshold. Universal provision of this benefit would cost"
73,18,"   approximately 11 percent of GDP, which Ghatak argues would require raising taxes"
73,19,"   and expanding the tax base, as well as cutting the nonmerit subsidies Bardhan and"
73,20,"   Joshi suggested scrapping. Ray (2016) has taken the debate in a somewhat differ-"
73,21,"   ent direction, proposing a “universal basic share” in which a fixed fraction of India’s"
73,22,"   GDP would be permanently committed to universal income provision. Figure B1.6.1"

74,2,"is of central importance for several reasons, including because jobs are a key vehicle for"
74,3,"poverty reduction as well as in shaping deeper societal identities. Box 1.7 lays out some"
74,4,"considerations on the meaning and role of jobs."
74,5,"        Technology has long been a source of anxiety, especially in Western societies."
74,6,"These fears are well grounded. Since the Industrial Revolution, workers have coexisted"
74,7,"with the threat of an ever-growing machine presence in agriculture, manufacturing, and"
74,8,"service jobs. In fact, the corporate labor share of employment declined steadily between"
74,9,"1975 and 2012, including in about three-quarters of advanced economies and two-thirds"
74,10,"of developing countries."
74,11,"    BOX 1.7 Jobs and Societies"
74,12,"    J    obs are more than income. Employment can shape mental and psychological"
74,13,"         welfare: evidence shows that jobs can affect individuals’ identity, self-worth,"
74,14,"    and sense of purpose, as well as bolster civic engagement and broader social"
74,15,"    cohesion. Generating jobs that fulfill the monetary and nonmonetary dimensions"
74,16,"    of well-being for all those willing and able to work should be a core societal aim."
74,17,"    Jobs are the premier vehicle for poverty reduction. Econometric studies show that"
74,18,"    sectoral employment intensity plays an important role in turning growth into pov-"
74,19,"    erty reduction—that is, when growth generates jobs for most of the labor force,"
74,20,"    particularly the poor. For example, in 10 of 18 Latin American countries—as well as"
74,21,"    in Germany and the United States—more than half of past poverty reduction was"
74,22,"    due to jobs (World Bank 2013)."
74,23,"    But many jobs may not provide adequate income, can be frustrating or degrading,"
74,24,"    or even generate negative externalities and forms of exploitation. Low-productiv-"
74,25,"    ity, low-quality jobs can keep people in poverty: between 54 and 63 percent of"
74,26,"    workers in Africa and Asia live on less than US$2/day. In other words, most poor"
74,27,"    people are poor workers."
74,28,"    The gulf between aspiration and reality—between a good job as the first-best"
74,29,"    option and the lower quantity and quality of jobs available in practice—has"
74,30,"    sparked long-standing debates on the role of social protection in helping bridge"
74,31,"    the gap. A range of supply-side interventions have been devised for enhancing"
74,32,"    people’s employability and reducing their distance from labor market demand."
74,33,"    Ensuing investments in human capital, skills, and intermediation have been and will"
74,34,"    remain key in the future. But against these efforts, labor demand has not always"
74,35,"    expanded, nor has the quality of jobs necessarily improved. This impasse has led"
74,36,"    to exploration of new avenues, including, among others, job guarantee programs"
74,37,"    and UBI itself. Chapter 2 discusses job guarantees in more detail."

75,2,"       Will this trend continue in the future? Most likely so, although the magnitude of"
75,3,"future automation or worker-machine substitution is unclear. For instance, for a pool of"
75,4,"countries, the share of jobs susceptible to automation range from the low single digits to"
75,5,"about half of the population (World Bank 2018b). Job losses should be balanced against"
75,6,"the generation of new jobs in innovative sectors that an appropriately absorbed and"
75,7,"managed technology can spur (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019). Whether the net job"
75,8,"balance is positive or not, substantial shares of workers may be at risk of technology-in-"
75,9,"duced unemployment and may not easily transition to newly generated occupations. It"
75,10,"is in this context that the idea of a UBI is gathering steam as insurance against such risk"
75,11,"(Standing 2017; Yang 2018). It is in response to concerns around technological change"
75,12,"that a number of the pilot programs discussed in this book are being launched. Tests in"
75,13,"the United States that are privately funded, including with support from the tech indus-"
75,14,"try, tend to fall in this category (e.g., Oakland pilot by Y Combinator; see appendix A)."
75,15,"       From this perspective, views on UBI hinge on how serious the technology, automa-"
75,16,"tion, or artificial intelligence–related threat is and, therefore, how proportionate or radical"
75,17,"the policy response should be. Two quotes may help crystallize those competing views."
75,18,"       [Artificial intelligence] does not call for a completely new paradigm for economic"
75,19,"       policy—for example, as advocated by proponents of replacing the existing social safety"
75,20,"       net with a UBI—but instead reinforces many of the steps we should already be taking"
75,21,"       to make sure that growth is shared more broadly. To date, in fact, the problem we have"
75,22,"       faced is not too much automation but too little automation. (Furman 2019, 317)"
75,23,"       UBI has the potential to give our troubled economy a twenty-first-century shot in the"
75,24,"       arm by transforming the technological distribution that’s been causing so much anxi-"
75,25,"       ety into a force for self-fulfillment and the common good. (Stern 2016, 171)"
75,26,"In a way, those who do not see the automation threat as warranting a UBI response"
75,27,"see the latter quote as a declaration of surrender to technology—that is, that society"
75,28,"has been unable to manage technology in a way that would enhance and innovate how"
75,29,"people work, instead of undermining the concept of labor itself. Conversely, among"
75,30,"those who believe such a tipping point has already been passed, a UBI emerges as a soci-"
75,31,"etal stronghold against an inevitable technological tsunami."
75,32,"       The somewhat polarized discussion on automation compounds other threads of"
75,33,"discontent with respect to labor markets and social protection. One thread stems from"
75,34,"the observation that, while employment is a key conduit for poverty reduction, jobs in"
75,35,"low- and middle-income countries may not always exert such a lifting role given their"
75,36,"low pay and low productivity.33 Relatedly, in high-income countries, wages can be flat rel-"
75,37,"ative to overall productivity increases. In both cases, UBI is cited as a way to supplement"
75,38,"chronically low earnings (Standing 2017)."
75,39,"       From another perspective, prevailing social insurance models were designed"
75,40,"assuming a single, stable, full-time employment relationship. Part-time and temporary"
75,41,"workers are typically insured in the same way as standard workers as long as they meet"
75,42,"the income and minimum contribution requirements. But the self-employed, those who"
75,43,
76,1,"52                                           Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
76,2,"often switch jobs, or those combining self- and dependent employment do not easily fit"
76,3,"into the framework of contributory social protection systems. These forms of employ-"
76,4,"ment pose questions for social protection.34 As underscored by the Organisation for"
76,5,"Economic Co-operation and Development, “rising numbers of nonstandard workers may"
76,6,"also erode the effectiveness of social protection systems. If taxes and social contributions"
76,7,"are payable only for some categories of workers, firms have an incentive to shift work to"
76,8,"workers who are less protected and less expensive” (OECD 2018, 1). These hurdles have"
76,9,"generated interest in simple, more uniform provision of social protection that encom-"
76,10,"passes all workers independently of how and where they work, potentially such as a UBI."
76,11,"      Trends in nonstandard employment (temporary and part-time employment, tri-"
76,12,"angular agency work, and “disguised” employment) are more mixed in middle-income"
76,13,"countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the prevalence of such forms of employ-"
76,14,"ment has been generally stable over the last two decades, while less homogeneous in"
76,15,"Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Apella and Zunino 2018). Yet in a number of developing"
76,16,"countries, the core challenge to the Bismarckian model is not necessarily posed by the"
76,17,"diversification of labor markets and automation, but by pervasive informality. In fact, 81"
76,18,"and 46 percent of workers hold informal jobs in low- and upper-middle-income countries,"
76,19,"respectively (World Bank 2018b). Given the endemic nature of the challenge and the slow"
76,20,"progress against it, new analytical work argues that most people would be better off with"
76,21,"a social protection system that does not depend on their work situation."
76,22,"      This evolving thinking has sparked new ideas on how to conceive of social assistance"
76,23,"that ensures an equity function for large swaths of the population, complemented by subsi-"
76,24,"dized insurance against catastrophic losses, while keeping contributory social insurance for"
76,25,"consumption-smoothing purposes. A UBI may be among the options to form such a social"
76,26,"assistance platform, taking the pressure off social insurance in pursuing distributional or"
76,27,"equity goals (Packard et al. 2019; Rutkowski 2018; World Bank 2018b)."
76,28,"Resource Dividends"
76,29,"A thread in the UBI discourse known as the dividend model has been the subject of ana-"
76,30,"lytical attention and practice, including at national and subnational levels. The model"
76,31,"generally involves contexts benefiting from large resource windfalls from oil and com-"
76,32,"modities. In a number of cases, there is limited public awareness of the level of such"
76,33,"revenues and their use. Also, those windfalls tend to coexist with vast amounts of regres-"
76,34,"sive subsidies (Devarajan 2018). To address this dual problem of inefficient subsidies"
76,35,"and state-citizen accountability, policy proposals have suggested redistributing part of"
76,36,"the oil revenues to the entire population in the form of a UBI and progressively taxing"
76,37,"it back to finance public goods. Taxation provides an incentive for citizens to demand"
76,38,"better services by the state, activating a virtuous cycle of more progressive assistance"
76,39,"while reigniting citizen scrutiny of state services (Devarajan et al. 2013; Sandefur 2017)."
76,40,"      Two country examples epitomize this model. Mongolia is the only country that has ever"
76,41,"had a full-fledged UBI: the program was introduced over the period 2010–12, before being"
76,42,"eventually scaled back due to fiscal constraints. The Islamic Republic of Iran’s energy-related"
76,43,
77,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                             53"
77,2,"subsidy reform presents an intriguing variant of a resource-rich dividend scheme. In 2011,"
77,3,"energy subsidies were replaced by cash transfers first reaching the full population and then"
77,4,"later, as a targeted subsidy, reaching about 90 percent of the population."
77,5,"       The redistribution of natural resources may not necessarily be motivated by effi-"
77,6,"ciency gains, but by social and environmental principles. The United States is illustrative"
77,7,"of two such examples. From a social perspective, the idea is to strengthen the social"
77,8,"fabric by engendering a sense of common purpose, with proceeds from natural resources"
77,9,"being a form of shareholder dividend for citizens. This is a rationale in line with Thomas"
77,10,"Paine’s seminal vision. Current models in Alaska and the Eastern Band of the Chero-"
77,11,"kee Nation epitomize this approach (Akee et al. 2018a, 2018b; Moss 2012; Widerquist"
77,12,"and Howard 2012). The Alaska Permanent Fund is designed to redistribute oil royalties"
77,13,"to residents, while the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation is related to casino profits:"
77,14,"since 1997, the tribal government has provided a portion of its dividends to 16,000 adult"
77,15,"tribal members. The average annual dividend is approximately US$4,000 per capita,"
77,16,"which is subject to federal taxation and split into two payments per year. In the next sub-"
77,17,"sections, we will briefly review large-scale, natural resource–related experiences from"
77,18,"Alaska, Mongolia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran."
77,19,"       From an environmental perspective, there are several proposals for a tax-and-divi-"
77,20,"dend carbon policy.35 If a carbon tax is proposed for its climate benefits, the question of"
77,21,"what to do with its revenues arises. In cases where carbon tax revenues are distributed"
77,22,"on a flat per capita basis, they could become a major vehicle for redistribution. This pro-"
77,23,"vides a clear link between the UBI and the climate change agenda."
77,24,"Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend"
77,25,"In 1967, the state of Alaska experienced a sudden windfall of oil wealth when North"
77,26,"America’s largest oil reserve was discovered on state-owned land. The lease sold for a"
77,27,"staggering US$900 million, seven times the state’s yearly budget. Led by Governor Jay"
77,28,"Hammond, a 1976 amendment to the state’s constitution required the state to deposit at"
77,29,"least 25 percent of each year’s natural resource revenues in an Alaska Permanent Fund."
77,30,"The fund revenues are invested in a savings account, with part of the interest paid annu-"
77,31,"ally to residents as a resource dividend."
77,32,"       Since 1982, every resident has been eligible for an annual UCT from the state."
77,33,"Individuals must apply each year, meet the residency criteria (be present in Alaska for"
77,34,"the preceding year, with the intent to remain indefinitely), and have no recent serious"
77,35,"criminal conviction. More than 90 percent of the population typically receives the divi-"
77,36,"dend. Unlike a true UBI, the amount is neither stable nor sufficient to meet basic needs:"
77,37,"dividends typically do not exceed 7 percent of the average annual income of recipients,"
77,38,"with inter-year fluctuations in transfer amounts between −61 percent and +9 percent,"
77,39,"or 19.8 percent on average (figure 1.4). The total dividend distribution has historically"
77,40,"amounted to half of the fund’s annual interest (averaged over the previous five-year"
77,41,"period), but this was recently reduced to allocate more of the fund’s earnings to the"
77,42,"state’s large deficit."

78,24,"       The Alaska Permanent Fund dividend has attracted significant public support"
78,25," across demographic, socioeconomic, and political divides. For instance, current public"
78,26," opinion favors raising taxes over ending the dividends (Isenberg 2017). The program has"
78,27," lowered poverty and inequality levels to among the nation’s lowest and stimulated the"
78,28," economy, generating over 7,000 jobs and US$1.1 billion in personal income, without"
78,29," producing inflation or reducing employment. In fact, recent evidence shows part-time"
78,30," work has increased by 1.8 percentage points, or 17 percent (Jones and Marinescu 2018)."
78,31," While the dividend may have not affected fertility rates, it has acted as a mild magnet"
78,32," for at least 12,000 migrants (Goldsmith 2012)."
78,33," The Islamic Republic of Iran’s Compensatory Cash Transfer Program"
78,34," The Iranian UBI scheme was born out of wider reform packages. In 2008, the government"
78,35," announced a set of sweeping reforms in energy and food subsidies. A compensatory means-"
78,36," tested UCT was considered. However, public opposition to means testing was growing. As a"
78,37," result, the targeting plan was abandoned, replaced instead with uniform universal cash trans-"
78,38," fers with the rich being discouraged from participating. In January 2010, Parliament approved"
78,39," the subsidy reform package and preparations were launched to publicize the changes, pre-"
78,40," pare the bank infrastructure, ensure universal account access, and reduce inflation ahead of"
78,41," the price increases (Salehi-Isfahani and Mostafavi-Dehzooei 2018; Tabatabai 2012)."
78,42,"        On December 19, 2010, the universal cash transfer was deposited in the bank"
78,43," accounts of household heads. At the same time, domestic energy and agricultural prices"
78,44," rose by up to 20 times (Reza Farzin, Guillaume, and Zytek 2011). At first, only 80 percent"
78,45,
79,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                                 55"
79,2,"of households registered for the scheme, a share that quickly rose to 96 percent. Efforts"
79,3,"to exclude the rich were put in place, but coverage remains at around 92 percent of the"
79,4,"population.36 The monthly cash transfer was set at Rls 455,000 (US$40–US$45) per"
79,5,"person—29 percent of median per capita income, and nearly three times the amount"
79,6,"envisaged in the subsidy reform law. The program absorbs nearly 3 percent of GDP."
79,7,"       The combination of subsidy reforms and sanctions triggered inflation rates that"
79,8,"eroded the transfers’ purchasing power by two-thirds of their original value by 2018. Even"
79,9,"so, the program brought about promising results. For example, empirical studies find over-"
79,10,"all no negative labor supply effect (on hours worked and participation); but the youth"
79,11,"worked a bit less (mostly because they were enrolling in higher education), while service"
79,12,"workers worked more (36 minutes/week) (Salehi-Isfahani and Mostafavi-Dehzooei 2018)."
79,13,"Mongolia’s Two-Year Experience with UBI"
79,14,"Mongolia began enjoying a major mining boom in the early 2000s, with growth rates"
79,15,"approaching 9 percent of GDP over 2002–08. In the run-up to the 2008 elections, politi-"
79,16,"cal parties competed over promises for cash transfers for the population. A new Human"
79,17,"Development Fund was established in 2009 to “create and grow sustainable permanent"
79,18,"resources to collect and evenly distribute them” (Yeung and Howes 2015). A key element"
79,19,"was to universalize the preexisting categorical child grant program, entitling all citizens"
79,20,"to a share in the nation’s mineral wealth."
79,21,"       The first universal cash transfer budget was set at Tog 324 billion, with transfers equat-"
79,22,"ing to Tog 120,000 (US$89) per citizen over the year. Unlike in Alaska, this amount was"
79,23,"based on electoral promises rather than the actual resource revenues accumulating in the"
79,24,"Human Development Fund. This left the program financing vulnerable to commodity price"
79,25,"drops. Eventually, this was exactly what happened, with copper prices plummeting and"
79,26,"slowly recovering (figure 1.5). After the first disbursement of Tog 70,000 (US$52) per citizen"
79,27,"in February 2010, payments quickly fell behind schedule, prompting protests. Attempts by"
79,28,"the government to negotiate alternative provision of social welfare services failed, and from"
79,29,"August to December 2010, monthly transfers amounted to only Tog 10,000 (US$7), which"
79,30,"was principally financed through government loans, since the actual mining revenue in the"
79,31,"fund was only half the annual cash transfer expenditure. From January 2011 to June 2012,"
79,32,"monthly transfers continued to be paid out at Tog 21,000 (US$17) per person, with the gov-"
79,33,"ernment constantly depending on borrowed funds to top up the mining revenue shortfall."
79,34,"       The program still managed to achieve some significant results: it reduced poverty"
79,35,"by up to a third, lowered inequality by up to 13 percent, and provided Mongolia with the"
79,36,"highest financial inclusion level among middle-income countries. However, the scheme"
79,37,"came with a hefty, ultimately unaffordable, price tag. Public external debt soared from"
79,38,"31 percent of GDP in 2010 to 48 percent in 2012. Cash transfers may also have contrib-"
79,39,"uted to inflation, although this remains untested. The program quickly lost public and"
79,40,"political support and was replaced, in June 2012, with the original child-targeted transfer"
79,41,"scheme. The Human Development Fund was replaced by a new sovereign wealth fund"
79,42,"focused solely on savings and investment.37"

80,30,"Conclusions"
80,31,"This chapter sheds light on some major queries in the global UBI debate. We here group"
80,32,"those issues around definitional matters, scope of the program, experiences to date, as"
80,33,"well as a set of strategic and programmatic choices. In general, our take is that, at least"
80,34,"for the moment, a UBI should be taken seriously, but not necessarily literally."
80,35,"      What is a UBI? The debate on a UBI is often chaotic and without precise defini-"
80,36,"tional contours. In many instances, a UBI is equated with guaranteed minimum income"
80,37,"schemes, while others define a universal program as one that does not establish any"
80,38,
81,1,"Chapter 1. The Idea of Universal Basic Income                                               57"
81,2,"eligibility criteria other than age. We propose a definition of UBI based on three core"
81,3,"design choices—that it is paid to all, unconditionally, and in cash—and discuss other"
81,4,"important features such as its amount and frequency, and whether children or noncit-"
81,5,"izens would benefit. A UBI is one particular pathway to achieve universality in social"
81,6,"protection, although differences exist on what “universality” actually means: should uni-"
81,7,"versality be interpreted as an outcome (e.g., “everybody should have a basic level of"
81,8,"income”), or in terms of coverage (e.g., “everybody should be covered by social pro-"
81,9,"tection”)? The term “coverage” itself is interpreted differently in social assistance (i.e.,"
81,10,"coverage as receipt of transfers) and social insurance (i.e., a promise of help if risks"
81,11,"materialize). These differences have important implications for the “targeting versus uni-"
81,12,"versality” debate."
81,13,"       What problem would a UBI try to solve? There are three different narratives in this"
81,14,"regard, which entail diverse designs and expectations. These are a desire to improve"
81,15,"social protection; the labor market story (interpreting UBI as insurance against artificial"
81,16,"intelligence–induced unemployment or diversified labor markets); and the redistribution"
81,17,"of natural resource revenues. The objectives of UBI are not only diverse, but sometimes"
81,18,"incompatible. For instance, a UBI linked to natural resource dividends may not fully align"
81,19,"with rights-based narratives. Similarly, UBI is sometimes interpreted as a backbone for"
81,20,"building stronger states; others look at it as a stepping stone to dismantling them. In a"
81,21,"1967 article, Friedman referred to a negative income tax—which shares a number of"
81,22,"similarities with UBI—as “…the only practicable route so far proposed for dismantling"
81,23,"gradually but thoroughly the jerry-built structure of government interferences with the"
81,24,"market and with individual liberty that have been adopted in the name of welfare… The"
81,25,"Left, if it accepts the program, will find that it has bought a Trojan Horse” (Friedman"
81,26,"1967). A UBI is a means, not a goal—a UBI is what countries make out of it."
81,27,"       A UBI is often associated with being a game changer in power redistribution (Stern"
81,28,"2016). Such calls may resonate and amplify preexisting perceptions of unfairness and"
81,29,"inequities that are creeping into the foundations of social contracts (Cottam 2019). There-"
81,30,"fore, a UBI may seem to offer a crisp, tangible way of meeting the appetite for change."
81,31,"But the generators of inequities may lie elsewhere; for example, in uneven access to"
81,32,"education and health systems, low-paying and low-productivity jobs, poorly function-"
81,33,"ing markets, corruption, regressive tax codes, unequal pay, and social discrimination,"
81,34,"among others. A UBI could help, but despite its scale, may not move the needle: follow-"
81,35,"ing Piketty (2016), “the problem with the discussion about basic income is that in most"
81,36,"instances it leaves the real issues unexplored and in reality expresses a concept of social"
81,37,"justice on the cheap.” This is not to downplay the societal role of UBI, but to set expecta-"
81,38,"tions right. In this spirit, the chapter discusses the kinds of bottlenecks (e.g., in terms of"
81,39,"factors hindering coverage) a UBI may likely help address, as well as others that it may"
81,40,"not—or may even amplify."
81,41,"       What is the global experience and evidence around UBI? No country currently has"
81,42,"such a scheme in place, and only two have done so temporarily (Mongolia and the"
81,43,"Islamic Republic of Iran). Those experiences offer some helpful insights into core ques-"
81,44,"tions, such as financing and inflation, while pilot programs are generating information"
81,45,
82,1,"58                                          Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
82,2,"on one or more defining features of a UBI. Yet systemwide issues are largely left unan-"
82,3,"swered, such as the relationship to the minimum wage, severance pay, or pensions."
82,4,"      Given current social assistance practices, the move toward an unconditional cash-"
82,5,"based transfer is plausible, though the extensive in-kind and conditioned programming"
82,6,"suggests that it may not be without controversy. The leap to universality within a single"
82,7,"social assistance program is definitely more radical. To date, attempts at universality"
82,8,"within social protection have largely been confined to social insurance. Just as the global"
82,9,"proliferation of cash transfers was once unimaginable, the prospect of providing cash for"
82,10,"everyone should not be ruled out."
82,11,"      As a radical solution, a UBI is bound to be thought-provoking. But when design"
82,12,"and financing details are laid out, it may be less extreme than envisaged, including"
82,13,"turning into a targeted program. And by sometimes playing a strawman role, a UBI"
82,14,"tends to expose the limits of current social protection systems (Ravallion 2017). How"
82,15,"to bring about improvements is perhaps the most fundamental question underlying the"
82,16,"UBI debate—that is, should countries build upon, improve, and extend what exists in"
82,17,"their social protection systems or should they introduce a radical new approach? And if"
82,18,"they do, do they risk “throwing the baby out with the bathwater”?"
82,19,"      These dilemmas entail the consideration of systemwide principles and programmatic"
82,20,"choices. At the systemwide level, there is broad demand for making the overall social"
82,21,"protection system inclusive, progressive, and adaptive. A UBI would score high in terms"
82,22,"of inclusiveness, as it would not differentiate among people in a polity; but the lack of"
82,23,"differentiation is precisely what makes the effects of a UBI uncertain on progressivity. As"
82,24,"chapter 4 shows, it is important to understand the overall distributional effects of a UBI,"
82,25,"but also to pay particular attention to the effects on those at the bottom of the distribu-"
82,26,"tion. A UBI would likely be a rigid instrument that may not fully adapt to a diversified"
82,27,"set of circumstances, especially in lower-income contexts (e.g., in terms of market con-"
82,28,"ditions, etc.)."
82,29,"      At the programmatic level, the choice would depend on the statement of the prob-"
82,30,"lem that UBI is intended to address—for example, whether technological advances will"
82,31,"eventually result in massive net job losses—and how well systems or a particular pro-"
82,32,"gram (e.g., UBI versus targeted cash transfers or versus regressive energy subsidies) are"
82,33,"working against that objective in a given context (Coady and Prady 2018; Harris et al."
82,34,"2018). Assessing the appropriateness and feasibility of UBI requires understanding and"
82,35,"working though the comparative trade-offs that any program or set of programs face in"
82,36,"terms of coverage, progressivity, adequacy, incentives, costs, financing options, political"
82,37,"economy, and delivery (i.e., the framework laid out in this volume’s overview, and that"
82,38,"this chapter has helped inform). None of these parameters have an easy and predeter-"
82,39,"mined outcome (Francese and Prady 2018; Ravallion 2018). A UBI is a seemingly simple"
82,40,"idea that involves complex choices. It is our hope that this chapter has helped unbundle"
82,41,"and navigate this complexity and, alongside the other chapters in this book, helps in"
82,42,"making informed choices."

83,5,"2.  Ricardo Anaya, candidate for Mexico’s presidential elections in July 2018, championed a UBI."
83,6,"    Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 elections in the United States,"
83,7,"    is doing the same."

83,10,"4.  In 1795, a specific variant introduced in Speenhamland, Berkshire, established the first poverty"
83,11,"    line consisting of three “gallon loaves” of bread per week per adult (plus adjustments by house-"
83,12,"    hold size). Wages were topped up to ensure that family income reached the poverty line, while"
83,13,"    the unemployed received full payment. This is often referred to as a UBI scheme, while it actu-"
83,14,"    ally was a minimum guarantee program. See chapter 2 for a discussion of such interventions."
83,15,"5.  In the United States, the antipoverty system was largely modeled after the Old Poor Law until"
83,16,"    the Great Depression, when the New Deal built federal institutional capacities for social pro-"
83,17,"    tection. Large-scale public works implemented in the early 1930s played a key role in moving"
83,18,"    away from local Old Poor Law relief schemes and weaving a national safety net. These devel-"
83,19,"    opments would pave the way for contemporary federal programs, such as the Supplemental"
83,20,"    Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; food stamps) of 1963 and the earned income tax credit"
83,21,"    of 1975."
83,22,"6.  This coverage is for pensions only, not for insurance related to health or work injury. For"
83,23,"    example, India’s Ayushman Bharat–PMJAY scheme covers about 500 million people, 40 per-"
83,24,"    cent of the country’s population (Blake et al. 2019)."
83,25,"7.  Another country, Iraq, has a truly universal social assistance program—the Public Distribution"
83,26,"    System—which is close to a UBI, but provides transfers in kind (Krishnan, Olivieri, and Rama-"
83,27,"    dan 2018)."
83,28,"8.  For an elegant treatment of the analytics of negative income tax programs, see Tondani (2009)."
83,29,"9.  Preliminary results show that the experiment did not increase employment but did augment the"
83,30,"    well-being (health and psychological status) of the treated unemployed (Kangas et al. 2019)."
83,31,"10. A puzzling example is the case of the municipality of Maricá in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According"
83,32,"    to some accounts, the municipality extended the preexisting targeted unconditional cash transfer"
83,33,"    to all its residents. The scheme is supposedly financed by oil revenues and covers about 150,000"
83,34,"    people. However, as part of this book’s research, we found that the scheme is not yet active and"
83,35,"    that a modified version will soon be launched (Moreira 2019). See also https://www.vox.com/"
83,36,"    future-perfect/2019/10/30/20938236/basic-income-brazil-marica-suplicy-workers-party."
83,37,"11. In New York City, for example, the recertification process for SNAP requires up to 17 different"
83,38,"    types of documents (Homonoff and Somerville 2019)."
83,39,"12. A related point is the possible ability of universal programs to avoid political clientelism (vote"
83,40,"    buying), since there is less room for politicians and officials to influence program participation."
83,41,"    In the context of health provision in the Philippines, for instance, Khemani (2013, 22) finds that"
83,42,"    “…vote buying is systematically negatively correlated with a particular type of service with the"
83,43,"    following characteristics—that which is the exclusive responsibility of municipal governments,"
83,44,"    that which is pro-poor (services which the rich do not use), and that which is a relatively broad,"
83,45,"    untargeted service, not particularly amenable to narrow targeting to select citizens.”"
83,46,
84,1,"60                                               Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
84,2,"13. In terms of political clientelism, this may hinge on the competitiveness of the political system,"
84,3,"    the level of poverty and size of the middle class, and the specific entry points for operational"
84,4,"    manipulation by local-level officials. Evidence from Argentina’s experience, for instance,"
84,5,"    shows that where political competition is high, clientelism creates an electoral trade-off: poli-"
84,6,"    ticians may gain votes among the poor, but at the cost of support from the middle class; thus,"
84,7,"    high competition is compatible with clientelism where poverty is high, but should decrease"
84,8,"    where poverty is low or in less-competitive contexts (Weitz-Shapiro 2012). And if the param-"
84,9,"    eters cited by Khemani (2013) are considered, a UBI would be managed centrally, not locally,"
84,10,"    and may be sufficiently attractive to nonpoor populations."
84,11,"14. The incidence of poverty, and hence the gap with safety net coverage, is even higher if national"
84,12,"    and relative measures of deprivation are used (Ravallion 2019)."
84,13,"15. More recently, to rectify the undercoverage, the Argentine government initiated nearly a"
84,14,"    million eligibility processes mostly based on improved national electronic data matching"
84,15,"    protocols and outreach efforts in communities where civil registration is incomplete. For"
84,16,"    instance, the government has linked 13 public databases and distinct ID registries for a sav-"
84,17,"    ings of US$104 million in reduced leakage and tax evasion (World Bank 2016)."
84,18,"16. For example, surveys of applicants for SNAP means-tested vouchers in Colorado and Illinois"
84,19,"    found that among SNAP applicants who were working, 15 percent lost pay because they"
84,20,"    missed work to visit the social services office. Furthermore, when asked which customer ser-"
84,21,"    vice improvements were most important to them, “being treated more respectfully” was the"
84,22,"    top priority for up to 17 percent of survey respondents; similarly, “getting a better explana-"
84,23,"    tion of how to apply for benefits” was the top priority for improvement for 11 to 22 percent"
84,24,"    of survey respondents, depending on the state. Also, among SNAP applicants facing emer-"
84,25,"    gencies or problems such as job loss, lack of sufficient food, loss of housing or care, and"
84,26,"    emergency medical needs, 60 percent reported that these situations could have been avoided"
84,27,"    or mitigated if they had received benefits more quickly (Isaacs, Katz, and Amin 2016)."
84,28,"17. These debates are not limited to social protection. For instance, for a discussion on the debate"
84,29,"    of generalized and targeted programs in education, see Evans and Yuan (2019)."
84,30,"18. Although this section focuses on conditional cash transfers, these are not the only conditional"
84,31,"    programs. Interventions such as school feeding, for instance, are long-standing and ample in"
84,32,"    coverage. The latest available data show that these are similar to CCTs in covering the poorest"
84,33,"    quintile (40.3 percent for CCTs, 37.1 percent for school feeding). Yet the debate on conditional"
84,34,"    in-kind transfers versus their unconditional form is not as widespread or contentious as is the"
84,35,"    case of cash."
84,36,"19. See Currie and Gahvari (2008) for further details on paternalism and interdependent prefer-"
84,37,"    ences."
84,38,"20. While these philosophical, political, and economic issues find their apex in CCT debates, they"
84,39,"    also permeate the discourse around certain types of public works programs and, to some"
84,40,"    extent, in-kind transfers. We examine the latter in the next section, and return to public works"
84,41,"    in the context of job guarantee programs in chapter 2."
84,42,"21. According to microeconomic models, an inframarginal in-kind transfer and a cash transfer"
84,43,"    of equal value would have the same effect in bolstering household food consumption—that"
84,44,"    is, beneficiaries’ marginal propensity to consume food out of an additional income from an"
84,45,"    in-kind or cash transfer should be the same. Put another way, there is only an income effect"
84,46,"    and no price effect associated with inframarginal transfers. For a broader and thought-provok-"
84,47,"    ing reflection on the economics of giving, see Reinhardt (2013)."

85,12,"    taxes. In 2000, Ackerman and Alstot suggested that every American receive a one-off grant of"
85,13,"    US$80,000 on his or her 21st birthday, or at age 18 for those enrolling in college. This was to"
85,14,"    be funded out of a dedicated annual tax of 2 percent levied on the wealthiest Americans."
85,15,"26. See Lokshin and Ravallion (2019) for a discussion on the missing market of working permits"
85,16,"    and how that compares to a UBI."
85,17,"27. Other proposals for introducing a UBI have focused on linking UBI transfers to country GDP,"
85,18,"    somewhat mirroring Alaska’s resource dividend model. Such proposals have been set forward"
85,19,"    for India by Ghatak and Muralidharan (2019) and Ray (2016)."
85,20,"28. Similar commitments were reiterated at the Third Financing for Development Conference"
85,21,"    in Addis Ababa in July 2015. In the following year, the World Bank and the International"
85,22,"    Labour Organization issued a declaration on “Shared Mission for Universal Social Protection,”"
85,23,"    whereby the organizations set out a vision of a world where “anyone who needs social pro-"
85,24,"    tection can access it at any time,” against which an objective was set to “increase the number"
85,25,"    of countries that can provide universal social protection, supporting countries to design and"
85,26,"    implement universal and sustainable social protection systems.”"
85,27,"29. See the International Labour Organization website, https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p="
85,28,"    NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:R202."
85,29,"30. When protracted over time, the lack of services from the state can lead to a vicious cycle of dis-"
85,30,"    illusionment whereby those, often large, sections of the population unreached or poorly served"
85,31,"    by the state are also the least likely to demand better welfare provisions (Holland 2017)."
85,32,"31. In some states, the Public Distribution System is entirely universal, as in Tamil Nadu and"
85,33,"    Himachal Pradesh (see Drèze and Khera 2017, table 7)."
85,34,"32. Looking at the UBI calculations, Drèze and Khera (2017) show that the amount created by"
85,35,"    removing nonmerit subsidies would be far lower than Bardhan (2017) and Joshi (2016) origi-"
85,36,"    nally suggested, since their initial estimates of 8–9 percent of GDP were based on 20-year-old"
85,37,"    data from the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy. Although Bardhan’s proposal"
85,38,"    used newer 2011–12 data estimating nonmerit subsidies to cost 5 percent, IMF (2017) anal-"
85,39,"    ysis suggests that this is still highly optimistic, with the actual figure likely only 2 percent."
85,40,"    Former finance minister Chidambaram also questions the fiscal validity of Bardhan’s and"
85,41,"    Joshi’s proposals to reclaim “revenues foregone,” highlighting the net economic damage that"
85,42,"    could result from reversing policies on special economic zones and specified infrastructure"
85,43,"    investments."
85,44,"33. Examining data from 28 low- and middle-income countries, Bonnet, Vanek, and Chen (2019)"
85,45,"    show that, on the one hand, in most countries the poverty rate of informal workers is between"
85,46,
86,1,"62                                               Ugo Gentilini, Margaret Grosh, and Ruslan Yemtsov"
86,2,"    2 and 10 times higher than that of formal workers; on the other hand, anywhere from 50 to"
86,3,"    98 percent of poor workers are informally employed."
86,4,"34. In the case of self-employment, for example, social insurance faces challenges because of"
86,5,"    uncertainty as to who is liable for employers’ contributions (having the self-employed pay"
86,6,"    both employer and employee contributions is unrealistic for many, as self-employed earnings"
86,7,"    are typically volatile). Also, the self-employed often have fluctuating earnings, with contribu-"
86,8,"    tors struggling to pay in bad years; and unemployment insurance for the self-employed raises"
86,9,"    moral hazard issues, as it can be difficult to assess whether they are in fact involuntarily"
86,10,"    unemployed."
86,11,"35. See for example https://www.econstatement.org/."
86,12,"36. Other countries have been more successful in promoting voluntary deselection from social"
86,13,"    assistance. For example, India’s Give It UP campaign, implemented as part of the liquid"
86,14,"    petroleum gas–related cash program reaching 177 million people, successfully promoted the"
86,15,"    exclusion of about 10 million wealthy individuals through a mix of public initiatives geared"
86,16,"    toward recognizing the gesture (online “champions and beneficiaries” with names published"
86,17,"    in the Ministry of Petroleum website, etc.). These efforts were underpinned by communica-"
86,18,"    tions to the affluent and the middle class on “nation building” and connecting to greater social"
86,19,"    goals, as well as bringing information and data on “unfair distribution” to the forefront. The"
86,20,"    program also established exclusion criteria based on legally binding self-declaration. Savings"
86,21,"    from these policies amounted to US$332 million/year (Gelb and Mukherjee 2019)."
86,22,"37. The Child Money Programme now covers 80 percent of households and proxy means testing"
86,23,"    is de facto used as an affluence test."

97,3,"Comparative Models and Instruments"
97,4,"Ugo Gentilini and Margaret Grosh"
97,5,"T"
97,6,"       he debate on universal basic income (UBI) is as hot ideologically as it is confus-"
97,7,"       ing analytically. Flagship programs and pilots are often being called a UBI while"
97,8,"       they are not, and those that clearly are not are sometimes called “quasi-UBI”—"
97,9,"       even if they only share one or two UBI properties as defined in chapter 1 (i.e.,"
97,10,"universality, unconditionality, transfers in the form of cash). Such loose standards imply"
97,11,"that virtually any program can be considered a quasi-UBI. For example, the proposal by"
97,12,"Felman et al. (2019) on a “quasi-universal basic rural income” for India is a large-scale"
97,13,"guaranteed minimum income (GMI) program. Quasi-UBI programs constitute the vast"
97,14,"majority of so-called UBI pilots laid out in chapter 1 and detailed in appendix A."
97,15,"      The reframing of different programs in UBI or quasi-UBI terms may be unhelpful"
97,16,"in several ways. For example, it confuses and polarizes current debate by trading accu-"
97,17,"racy for public resonance; it risks reinventing the wheel around key questions for which"
97,18,"there might be a considerable knowledge base (e.g., do quasi-UBI programs discourage"
97,19,"work?); it may amplify the gulf between expectations (everyone gets cash) and actual"
97,20,"program design (only some receive cash); and it may not elucidate the nuanced, distinct"
97,21,"features that a suite of alternative social protection measures possess to pursue similar"
97,22,"objectives. This chapter, therefore, is meant to help inject some analytical clarity around"
97,23,"UBI and the universe of programs that populate the “quasi-UBI” universe. It does so by"
97,24,"contrasting UBI features against the structure of other programmatic options—including"
97,25,"sketching out their features as well as identifying their pros and cons to fit a particular"
97,26,"goal and context."
97,27,"      The chapter is organized as follows: the next section outlines four broad categories"
97,28,"of program instruments, which are then detailed in the subsequent four sections. These"

98,2,"present specific experiences with and the relative merits of each family of measures. The"
98,3,"chapter’s final two sections reflect on emerging implications for the debate on universal-"
98,4,"ity, and provide conclusions, respectively. Table 2.2 at the end of the chapter presents a"
98,5,"summary comparison of UBI and seven other instruments."

98,7,"There is a broad range of benefit structures available in social assistance. These can"

98,25,"                                                   activation measures. Because a UBI is"
98,26,"                                                   often debated alongside job guarantee"
98,27,"programs (JGPs), we offer an overview of wage-based programs that gravitate around the"
98,28,"jobs-related agenda for vulnerable populations. In particular, we examine schemes like"
98,29,"JGPs and public works that involve the financing of a full project beyond wage payments,"
98,30,"as well as wage subsidies and the earned income tax credit (EITC), which normally cover"
98,31,"wage costs only. We do not discuss insurance, as UBI, with its benefit uniformity, may"
98,32,"intrinsically not substitute for the ability of insurance to make specific payouts when"
98,33,"(and only when) the individual, household, or worker incurs a large loss."
98,34,"       As further detailed in the next sections, an important feature of each option is the"
98,35,"level of support given and how it changes with income or age. Some of the variants are"
98,36,"depicted in figure 2.1. Child allowances and social pensions offer a flat benefit paid to all"
98,37,"those in specific age groups, as shown in figure 2.1a. When those benefits are provided"
98,38,"based on the sole eligibility criteria of age, they are called “universal” (although they are"
98,39,"de facto targeted by age). A UBI offers a flat benefit to all, and is found in figure 2.1b."
98,40,"       There are several kinds of programs with benefits tightly linked to income, also"
98,41,"shown in figure 2.1b, such as means-tested GMI programs, with benefits phasing out as"
98,42,"income increases. Programs with more extended tapering, like the negative income tax"
98,43,"(NIT), have broader coverage than a typical GMI but are a conceptual extension of such"
98,44,"measures. Although with a slightly different phase-in benefit structure and limited only"
98,45,"to earners who file for personal income taxes, programs like the EITC could also fit in"
98,46,"this panel, although, as we discuss later in the chapter, the EITC presents a slightly dif-"
98,47,"ferent structure."

99,12,"        Other poverty-targeted benefits are similar in that they are available only to fami-"
99,13," lies or individuals below some income threshold, but have less smooth benefit structures."
99,14," They may pay a flat benefit per household, or per member of the household who meets"
99,15," some criteria of age or behaviors. For example, an unconditional cash transfer might pay"
99,16," a flat benefit to poor households; a conditional cash transfer program might pay one"
99,17," for each child of school age who attends school regularly. These programs may also be"
99,18," approximated in figure 2.1b, as they present a similar structure to GMIs."
99,19,"        These models only trace the benefit side of programs. When their financing comes"
99,20," into play, the shape of a program could well be altered (Banerjee, Niehaus, and Suri 2019;"
99,21," Hoynes and Rothstein 2019). In fact, in several low- and middle-income countries, the"
99,22," poorest households can be net tax payers—that is, they pay more in direct or indirect"
99,23," taxes than they receive in support from the state (Lustig 2018)."
99,24,"        Similarly, with a UBI, some individuals may pay more in taxes than they receive"
99,25," in benefits, so the net incidence of the benefit is unlikely to be the same flat incidence"
99,26," implied in the figure. In this vein, figure 2.2 contrasts the net benefit incidence of the"

100,4,"discussed in chapter 4, if the financing side of the UBI were from a progressive personal"
100,5,"income tax system, then the net incidence of a UBI would look more like that of the NIT.2"
100,6,"In other words, a UBI financed via progressive income taxation is de facto targeted via"
100,7,"taxes (Francese and Prady 2018; IMF 2017; Ravallion 2018)."
100,8,"Benefit-Based Programs Not Based on Work"
100,9,"Child Allowances and Social Pensions"
100,10,"Social pensions and child allowances are often deemed the closest programs to a UBI."
100,11,"There is a fundamental conceptual difference, however, in that the age-based programs"
100,12,"are built for categories of people not expected to work. In this way, they can be thought"
100,13,"to cover specific life-cycle risks. When social pensions or child allowances are called “uni-"
100,14,"versal,” they are based on age only and with no means test or on a history of earnings"
100,15,"and contributions (as in a minimum pension provision in a contributory scheme)."
100,16,"       The benefit level for child allowances is conceptualized as being a supplement to"
100,17,"income to help families (who are assumed to have at least one, often two, active earn-"
100,18,"ers) avoid poverty when they increase the number of dependents. A recent review by"
100,19,"the International Labour Office and the United Nations Children’s Fund shows that child"
100,20,"grants are present in universal form in 21 countries, and in a “quasi” form in another 14"
100,21,"(ILO and UNICEF 2019). The latter are categorized as being short term, affluence tested,"
100,22,"and coordinated schemes"
100,23,"       The benefit level for social pensions is conceptualized as a replacement to income"
100,24,"for the elderly (former workers) who no longer work. As such, transfers tend to be higher"
100,25,"than the benefit for other safety nets. Overall, such programs exist in about 101 coun-"
100,26,"tries. In most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries,"
100,27,"social pensions are not “universal,” as they are means tested. The same is true in Latin"
100,28,"America, while Europe and Central Asia display the widest share of universal social pen-"
100,29,"sions (World Bank 2018). The first such program was New Zealand’s scheme founded"
100,30,"in 1898, with a rich history of proliferation throughout Africa and the Caribbean islands"
100,31,"following the publication of the Beveridge Report in 1942 (Seekings 2013).3"
100,32,"       The age at which social pensions are granted averages around 65 in most regions,"
100,33,"but varies from as low as 55 to as high as 80. Often the pension age for women is five"
100,34,"years younger than for men. Brazil, Mauritius, and South Africa have the most gener-"
100,35,"ous programs, providing over 60 percent of the income of recipient households in the"
100,36,"poorest quintile; but these programs are the exception, and in general benefits are sub-"
100,37,"stantially lower. In countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Mexico, and Turkey, the"
100,38,"amount of the noncontributory pension represents less than 40 percent of the value of"
100,39,"the national poverty line. Older people receiving a social pension in these countries are"
100,40,"still poor (ILO 2018)."
100,41,
101,1,"Chapter 2. UBI as Social Assistance: Comparative Models and Instruments                   77"
101,2,"       Categorical benefits such as child grants and social pensions present a number of"
101,3,"positive features. These include their simplicity and transparency, including their being"
101,4,"easily communicated to and understood by the public. Also, as other forms of cash"
101,5,"transfers they can help support the costs of child rearing and help invest in human cap-"
101,6,"ital. Furthermore, they do not require data collection and verification other than age,"
101,7,"thus eliminating possibly contentious needs-based eligibility metrics. They may also"
101,8,"exert possible political appeal. On the other hand, they present several challenges. For"
101,9,"instance, they exclude those who do not meet age criteria, even if in need (depending"
101,10,"on how age correlates with poverty). They can be expensive depending on the country’s"
101,11,"demographics and may generate possible undesirable effects on fertility, depending on"
101,12,"their design. However, as mentioned earlier in the book, the impact on fertility in low-"
101,13,"and middle-income countries is largely unsupported by the evidence."
101,14,"Guaranteed Minimum Income"
101,15,"Although the GMI’s minimum income and the UBI’s basic income may sound similar,"
101,16,"they are at opposite poles in degree of targeting and benefit structure. Also, they are"
101,17,"usually far different in conditionalities, though both are paid in cash. A GMI ensures a"
101,18,"minimum to any family that falls below a given income threshold—and just enough to"
101,19,"bring them to that minimum. In this way, a GMI tends to display limited coverage at the"
101,20,"bottom of the income distribution, with benefits sharply tapered as income rises. This"
101,21,"contrasts markedly to the universal and flat UBI benefit. With its steep taper, if the GMI"
101,22,"program eligibility threshold is at the poverty line, then poverty would be eradicated at"
101,23,"the lowest budgetary cost. This potential efficiency comes at a cost of possibly introduc-"
101,24,"ing very significant disincentives to work. In pure form, for all households with incomes"
101,25,"below the GMI thresholds, any income from labor or other earnings will induce an equal"
101,26,"amount in benefit reduction—that is, a 100 percent marginal tax rate. GMI programs are"
101,27,"administratively demanding, requiring a means to assess eligibility rather exactly and to"
101,28,"customize benefits according to need upon entry and as need varies over time."
101,29,"       Because the design of GMI programs may discourage work, programs rarely"
101,30,"operate in pure form. Most GMI-type programs have income disregards or moderated"
101,31,"withdrawal of benefits. The low eligibility threshold also implies that GMI recipient fam-"
101,32,"ilies are less likely to contain earners, often supporting families where the adults are"
101,33,"elderly, (partially) disabled, single mothers of young children, and/or poorly educated"
101,34,"and living in areas with few opportunities. Low eligibility thresholds provide families that"
101,35,"do have active earners with incentives to make a work effort sufficient to earn an income"
101,36,"above the guarantee. And GMI programs often require some sort of activation measure"
101,37,"for “work able” adults—registration with the public employment service or active job"
101,38,"search; sometimes training or community service; sometimes a customized plan for the"
101,39,"family or members in it to address barriers to work."
101,40,"       In practice, GMI programs are concentrated in Europe and Central Asia, where 15"
101,41,"countries have such programs. Several other emerging economies have either introduced"
101,42,"GMI programs (e.g., Dibao in China, and the top-up to Brazil’s Bolsa Família benefit) or"
101,43,
102,1,"78                                                           Ugo Gentilini and Margaret Grosh"
102,2,"are planning to do so (Turkey). Spending on the GMI varies across countries, from signif-"
102,3,"icant (such as in Armenia, which spends 1 percent of gross domestic product [GDP]) to"
102,4,"moderate (e.g., Albania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of"
102,5,"Macedonia, and Montenegro, which devote around 0.5 percent of GDP) to almost negli-"
102,6,"gible (Belarus, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania). In a number of countries, those"
102,7,"programs show a low coverage rate, including in newly adopted schemes across South-"
102,8,"ern Europe (World Bank 2019). In other countries, coverage has declined. For example,"
102,9,"in Poland, the number of recipients of means-tested household benefits dropped from"
102,10,"3.8 million in 2008 to about 2.3 million in 2013, partly because the income threshold"
102,11,"was not indexed to inflation (World Bank 2018)."
102,12,"       To summarize, the advantages of GMI programs are that they reduce poverty at"
102,13,"low fiscal cost, a focus on the poor may have societal resonance, and a “gap-filling”"
102,14,"function may be appropriate in contexts of transitory shocks and economic business"
102,15,"cycles. Among the disadvantages, it is worth highlighting the likely work disincentives"
102,16,"that, by design, entail both high income and substitution effects. Another disadvantage"
102,17,"is that risks of exclusion are high in contexts of high poverty prevalence and exten-"
102,18,"sive population concentration around poverty lines. Moreover, a GMI is administratively"
102,19,"demanding, requiring both complex initial eligibility decisions and frequent updating of"
102,20,"benefit amounts or recertification of eligibility (often every 3, 6, or 12 months)."
102,21,"Other Poverty-Based Cash Transfers"
102,22,"Most cash transfer programs in developing countries do not have the capacity to observe"
102,23,"and manage means testing to run a GMI-type program. In these cases, programs use some"
102,24,"combination of proxies for income—assets, family structure, characteristics of earners,"
102,25,"geography, etc. They may use data collected in the field from households or community"
102,26,"members rather than existing governmental databases in eligibility assessments. The"
102,27,"vast majority try to focus benefits toward the bottom end of the distribution—sometimes"
102,28,"as tightly as on the bottom 5 or 10 percent of the population, sometimes extending to"
102,29,"the bottom 20 or 30 percent—although a few are more inclusive."
102,30,"       Often, eligibility decisions are made on simple in/out distinctions or with house-"
102,31,"holds placed in multiple bands of need with different levels of benefits. Programs may"
102,32,"have a flat benefit structure and give the same amount to every household within a"
102,33,"given band. Also, programs may give an amount differentiated by number of family"
102,34,"members, or provide set levels for members with different characteristics—preschool"
102,35,"children, children in school, disabled family members, the elderly—sometimes with a"
102,36,"flat supplement for the poorest households."
102,37,"       Into this broad set of programs fall poverty-targeted child allowances, social pen-"
102,38,"sions, and disability assistance as well as the prototypical conditional cash transfers and"
102,39,"unconditional cash transfers. Some of the flagship programs may have substantial cov-"
102,40,"erage goals, but as discussed in chapter 1, many more programs are smaller and with"
102,41,"design parameters that yield bigger target populations than their budgets will support."
102,42,"Thus, coverage is incomplete, both of the total population and of the poorest quintile or"
102,43,
103,1,"Chapter 2. UBI as Social Assistance: Comparative Models and Instruments                       79"
103,2,"nationally defined poverty thresholds. Again as discussed in chapter 1, limited coverage"
103,3,"is the result of other factors too, including a range of delivery issues (e.g., lack of identifi-"
103,4,"cation, outreach, or awareness, etc.) as well as limitations inherent in the proxies utilized"
103,5,"(Brown, Ravallion, and van de Walle 2018; Guven and Leite 2016; Kidd and Athias 2019;"
103,6,"Özler 2017)."
103,7,"        Given the variation in designs and targeting mechanisms, incidence varies between"
103,8,"programs, although its overall shape is progressive. Taken as a category (with the inci-"
103,9,"dence of individual programs of different designs lumped together), unconditional cash"
103,10,"transfers deliver about 38 percent of their benefits to the poorest quintile. Conditional"
103,11,"cash transfers, which are more likely to be poverty targeted, deliver about 45 percent of"
103,12,"their benefits to the poorest quintile (World Bank 2018)."
103,13,"        While programs denominated as child allowances, social pensions, or disability"
103,14,"assistance tend to be unconditional, many other cash transfer programs have some sort of"
103,15,"soft conditions to ensure that families seek age-appropriate health and education services"
103,16,"for their children. Such accompanying measures have shown significant results in reduc-"
103,17,"ing malnutrition and gender-based violence (Buller et al. 2018; Hidrobo and Roy 2019)."
103,18,"        Similarly, an increasing share of programs, both unconditional and conditional with"
103,19,"respect to social services, provide allied nudges, services, or asset transfers designed to"
103,20,"increase earnings in recipient families. They are usually not linked to European-style"
103,21,"public employment services or job search requirements, but to productive inclusion ele-"
103,22,"ments to increase entrepreneurship and business skills, savings, or credit—and thus"
103,23,"working assets and income (Veras Soares and Orton 2017). The evidence base on such"
103,24,"graduation programs reveals positive results, especially in the immediate years after pro-"
103,25,"gram completion, even in fragile states (Bedoya et al. 2019). However, evidence from"
103,26,"Ethiopia and Uganda shows that impacts tend to fade in subsequent years, documenting"
103,27,"a convergence between control and treatment groups4 (Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez"
103,28,"2018; Blattman, Dercon, and Franklin 2019)."
103,29,"        Overall, like GMI schemes, other poverty-targeted programs can be cost-effective in"
103,30,"reducing monetary poverty and engender possible political appeal due to financing and"
103,31,"co-responsibilities. When connected explicitly or implicitly to social services, cash trans-"
103,32,"fers could also fit more organically in broader efforts to build human capital (Bastagli et"
103,33,"al. 2019). However, programs may require observed or proxies to income, which may"
103,34,"be unavailable, difficult to collect regularly, and present a mixed track record of perfor-"
103,35,"mance. Also, programs such as conditional cash transfers may be relatively rigid to scale"
103,36,"up—unless conditions can be lifted on an exceptional basis, as in the Philippines (Gen-"
103,37,"tilini, Laughton, and O’Brien 2018)—and may exclude vulnerable, nonpoor households."
103,38,"Tax-Based Programs Not Based on Work"
103,39,"It has been claimed that the negative income tax represents “…one of the funda-"
103,40,"mental ideas of modern analysis of welfare programs” (Moffitt 2003, 3), especially in"
103,41,"high-income countries. As with the GMI, the NIT represents the notion of a pure form of"

104,2,"      fine-tuning tax and transfers according to welfare. It is like a GMI with a possibly higher"
104,3,"      threshold and gentler tapering. The NIT poses the same kind of information demands"
104,4,"      as a GMI, but more extensively as it covers the full income distribution and relies even"
104,5,"      more on actual income. Like the GMI, the NIT produces a high marginal tax rate, though"

104,32,"      through means testing as in the NIT, versus indirectly through progressive income tax"
104,33,"      rates in a UBI, is analytically the same as far as disposable income is concerned. In both"
104,34,"      cases the decision about balancing the steepness of the taper and the break-even point"
104,35,"      would be taken in the tax code. The key difference is that NIT is focused on taxing and"
104,36,"      transferring less, and UBI on taxing and transferring more."
104,37,"             Both programs face the same dilemma in balancing minimum guaranteed support,"
104,38,"      the effective marginal tax rate on benefits, and the break-even point where members"
104,39,"      of society become a net contributor to government coffers. But perhaps a UBI could be"
104,40,"      deemed less transparent than the NIT option, chiefly because it may be less explicit or"
104,41,"      visible who is paying for whom. UBI may be superior to NIT, however, in reaching the"
104,42,"      poorest (who work mostly in informal activities) and on intertemporal risk management"
104,43,"      (because of transfer frequency). In a way, there is no NIT without a full tax system. A"
104,44,"      UBI could still be paid without a full-fledged system by, for example, taxing resource (or"
104,45,"      carbon tax) revenues and simply redistributing the resources to everyone. This would"
104,46,"      not be possible under NIT, since income and tax declaration are tied to differentiated"
104,47,"      amounts of benefits received. As such, UBI could be seen as a steppingstone toward"
104,48,"      NIT—and perhaps one more suitable for informal settings. In those circumstances,"
104,49,"      however, there are also proposals to identify proxies that are normally correlated with"
104,50,"      consumption, collect them digitally, include them in social registries, and use the over-"
104,51,"      all information to mimic NIT. Such a tapered UBI would present features somewhere in"
104,52,"      between UBI, NIT, and GMI (Majoka and Palacios 2019; Packard et al. 2019)."

105,2,"Benefit-Based Programs Based on Work"
105,3,"Job Guarantee Programs"
105,4,"JGPs, like GMI programs, are a promise that anyone who does not earn an income in"
105,5,"the private market that meets a societally defined minimum will receive support—in"
105,6,"this case, not through a top-up transfer but through (additional) work. JGPs are open to"
105,7,"anyone willing to work at the defined (low) wage. They are open ended in duration and"
105,8,"do not envisage targeting criteria or eligibility requirements other than willingness to"
105,9,"work and possibly age and citizenship or immigration status. JGPs have two objectives:"
105,10,"to generate productive employment and to ensure adequate income. A fundamental"
105,11,"question is whether JGPs can really achieve their competing objectives simultaneously in"
105,12,"full measure, and if not, to which to give the most importance."
105,13,"        If a JGP’s main objective is to generate jobs, it should not, contrary to most analyses,"
105,14,"be compared to programs such as a UBI; instead, it should be weighed against demand-"
105,15,"side measures of the labor market. The more direct of these range from wage subsidies to"
105,16,"capital injection to firms; the less direct measures include opening trade markets, “doing"
105,17,"business” style reforms, and even adjusting fiscal and monetary policy. Relative to many"
105,18,"such policies, however, investments in JGPs may go into workers’ pockets more directly."
105,19,"        If the core identity of JGPs is to provide income through a job of last resort (with the"
105,20,"quality or value of work secondary), the appropriate comparisons to alternative policies"
105,21,"is more with social assistance programs such as cash transfers (and indeed a UBI), which"
105,22,"entail debates around universality versus targeting, conditionality (e.g., work require-"
105,23,"ments), and transfer modalities. JGPs would be openly self-targeted and more generous"
105,24,"than typical social assistance."
105,25,"        JGPs strive to create meaningful jobs, but there is usually tension between the number"
105,26,"and caliber of jobs that can be provided. Common options for productive jobs include those"
105,27,"in the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure and those in public services"
105,28,"(such as child or elder care, assistance to the disabled, teachers, library assistants, commu-"
105,29,"nity health workers, clerical workers to digitize records, etc.). These are functions with value"
105,30,"but are often underprovided due to budget constraints in the public agencies that finance"
105,31,"the services. JGP proponents hope that by moving social welfare spending into a jobs mode,"
105,32,"the poor will receive support, and society will benefit from the labor used. This double ben-"
105,33,"efit is indeed attractive, though it will not be realized in full measure. To subsidize a job will"
105,34,"cost more than the wages paid (transfer received by) the worker—some measure of tools,"
105,35,"supplies, or raw materials; complementary skilled labor; and management will be needed as"
105,36,"well for productive work. Moreover, it may be difficult to provide enough useful jobs—that is,"
105,37,"those that could be useful to society but are not provided by the private sector."
105,38,"        To provide employment with adequate incomes, JGP proposals may suggest wages"
105,39,"more generous than typical low-skilled jobs (proposals in the United States include a poten-"
105,40,"tial minimum wage of US$15/hour plus benefits). In doing so, they may raise the demand"
105,41,"for work in the guarantee program—the higher the pay, the more workers it will attract."
105,42,"Moreover, the wage in the guarantee program may affect wages in the private sector. The"

106,1,"82                                                             Ugo Gentilini and Margaret Grosh"
106,2,"interpretation of such an effect can differ. That firms would have to raise their worker com-"
106,3,"pensation is a welcome feature for some: “…yes, we want to disrupt business models that can"
106,4,"only be successful if they pay poverty-level wages without the benefits that are common in all"
106,5,"of the developed countries” (Tcherneva 2018, 1). Yet, JGPs as a whole are subject to compet-"
106,6,"ing narratives: part of the literature posits that since everyone would be employed, workers"
106,7,"would be empowered (by eliminating reserve employees or the fear of unemployment). A"
106,8,"different strand of thinking suggests that while everyone would be employed, JGPs would not"
106,9,"strengthen workers’ bargaining position; rather, they would simply replace welfare with work"
106,10,"requirements (Bruenig 2018). It is no wonder JGPs are sparking fascinating debates around"
106,11,"the role of work in societies, and about the deeper relationship between employment, pov-"
106,12,"erty, and society (Gentilini 2018a, 2018c; Ravallion 2018; World Bank 2013)."
106,13,"       In a full-fledged JGP, the state offers continuous employment to anyone. In practice,"
106,14,"this model is almost never purely implemented. There are historical experiences in the"
106,15,"United States during the Great Depression (Harvey 2007), and some might consider the"
106,16,"Chilean programs in the 1980s analogous."
106,17,"       Presently, India is the only country operating a form of JGP, although employment days"
106,18,"per family are capped at 100/year in rural areas. The National Rural Employment Guarantee"
106,19,"Scheme (NREGS) costs nearly 0.3 percent of GDP, with wage costs absorbing 67 percent of"
106,20,"the budget. Almost 25 percent of rural households participate in the scheme, mostly women"
106,21,"(55 percent) (Drèze and Khera 2017). However, there is a significant rationing of jobs—that is,"
106,22,"not everyone who wants work gets it. Only 56 percent of applicants eventually participate (a"
106,23,"share that declines to one-third in low-income states), mostly due to leakages (Ravallion 2019)."
106,24,"       Interestingly, and differing somewhat from the public works literature, second-round"
106,25,"labor market effects of the NREGS have been the subject of considerable empirical scru-"
106,26,"tiny. Berg et al. (2012) show a 5.3 percent increase in the real daily agricultural wage"
106,27,"rate across India due to the NREGS. The authors find that the program mainly affects"
106,28,"the wages of unskilled laborers, and the wage effects are stronger in districts where the"
106,29,"program was first rolled out. Azam (2012) documents significant increases in public"
106,30,"sector employment and labor force participation as a result of the NREGS, particularly for"
106,31,"women. The paper also indicates that the NREGS helps to narrow gender wage gaps—the"
106,32,"wages for female casual workers increase 8 percent more in NREGS districts compared"
106,33,"to non-NREGS districts, whereas the impact on male wages is less than 1 percent. Other"
106,34,"gender effects include psychological benefits, with a reduction in depression symptoms"
106,35,"due to economic security and independence. Such effects are particularly strong among"
106,36,"marginalized groups. In some states, lean-season poverty is cut by half for scheduled"
106,37,"caste and tribal households. The NREGS also revived institutions of local democracy, such"
106,38,"as gram panchayats (village councils) and gram sabhas (village assemblies)."
106,39,"       Imbert and Papp (2015) find a 4.7 percent increase in the daily wages of casual labor-"
106,40,"ers, a 1.2 percent increase in public employment, and a 1.5 percent decrease in private"
106,41,"sector employment in NREGS early adoption districts, compared to those that received"
106,42,"the program later. These wage and employment effects are concentrated in seven “star"
106,43,"states” where the NREGS is well implemented.5 Additionally, the NREGS decreased the"
106,44,"likelihood of migration by 8–11 percentage points (Adhikari and Gentilini 2018)."

107,2,"      Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2017) provide labor market evidence based"
107,3,"on a large-scale randomized experiment of biometric smart cards in Andhra Pradesh"
107,4,"aimed at improving NREGS implementation. Although it only finds weak increases in pri-"
107,5,"vate sector employment, the paper documents significant decline in days without paid"
107,6,"work by 7.1 percent in treated areas. In addition, the authors find a 6.1 percent increase"
107,7,"in private sector wages for unskilled labor in the month of June, and a 5.8 percent increase"
107,8,"in reported reservation wages.6 Importantly, regardless of actual participation in the public"
107,9,"works, all NREGS-registered households have benefited from these wage gains."
107,10,"Temporary Public Works Programs"
107,11,"Over the past decades, public works have been one of the most popular social assistance"
107,12,"interventions worldwide, from Afghanistan to the United States. According to Eurostat"
107,13,"data, in 2015 over 1.1 million people participated in direct job creation public works pro-"
107,14,"grams in the European Union, for the equivalent of around US$9.5 billion in spending"
107,15,"(Gentilini 2018c). Currently, in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, there are 70 public works pro-"
107,16,"grams in 29 countries (Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve 2018). There are five models of"
107,17,"temporary public works programs in addition to JGPs. While not exhaustive and with the"
107,18,"categories not mutually exclusive, this typology may provide a way to chart issues and"
107,19,"trade-offs emerging from cross-country experiences."
107,20,"      •• Safety net approach: temporary income support and consumption smoothing."
107,21,"         Under this category, projects offer short-term income support, typically as a"
107,22,"         response to some form of acute and temporary crisis, including natural disasters"
107,23,"         and economic shocks. The income transfer function tends to dominate other"
107,24,"         objectives, with assets/services in some instances consisting of light activities"
107,25,"         (e.g., due to fears of dependency, political economy, societal views on co-respon-"
107,26,"         sibilities, etc.). The share of wages compared to total expenditures is typically"
107,27,"         between 60 and 80 percent, with wages themselves set below the market wage"
107,28,"         for unskilled labor to avoid market disruption and encourage the poorest to par-"
107,29,"         ticipate. As such, these programs tend to offer basic consumption smoothing for"
107,30,"         the poor, particularly on a self-targeting basis.7 Latvia’s Workplace with Stipend"
107,31,"         program is an example of such an approach. In the context of a severe eco-"
107,32,"         nomic downturn, the scheme generated 190,000 jobs with a duration between"
107,33,"         two weeks and six months for light labor-intensive activities (e.g., public space"
107,34,"         cleaning). The scheme was rapidly scaled up from 16,000 jobs (December"
107,35,"         2009) to 186,000 (January 2010). The low wage (80 percent of minimum wage)"
107,36,"         resulted in about 96 percent of beneficiaries being in the bottom 40 percent of"
107,37,"         the income distribution, with the program being largely oversubscribed (Azam,"
107,38,"         Ferré, and Ajwad 2012; Gentilini 2015)."
107,39,"      •• Asset provision: infrastructure created and services rendered. The primary objective"
107,40,"         of this model is the provision of assets and services rather than income transfer."
107,41,"         Within large infrastructure projects, there is an attempt to intensify the amount"
107,42,
108,1,"84                                                          Ugo Gentilini and Margaret Grosh"
108,2,"      of labor utilized to maximize employment—that is, expenditures shift the factor"
108,3,"      intensity from capital to labor. For instance, projects by the International Labour"
108,4,"      Organization’s Employment Intensive Investment Programme are classic exam-"
108,5,"      ples of this intervention model. Programs may resemble some area-based"
108,6,"      interventions involving technical lines, especially in ministries of transport, and"
108,7,"      urban and rural development. Another variant takes a more services-oriented"
108,8,"      perspective. For example, the Community Employment Programme in Ireland"
108,9,"      was launched in 1994 in response to high long-term unemployment rates.8"
108,10,"   •• Social cohesion and peacebuilding: pursuing social externalities. In some cases,"
108,11,"      public works are designed with an implicit objective of promoting social cohe-"
108,12,"      sion and stability, especially in times of political turmoil. Public works can be"
108,13,"      popular ways for governments in postconflict countries to gain legitimacy and"
108,14,"      promote positive perceptions by providing income to large numbers of people"
108,15,"      quickly while rebuilding community assets. Many demobilization, disarmament,"
108,16,"      and rehabilitation–related employment programs in fragile and postconflict"
108,17,"      contexts may fall into this category—one example being the Youth Employment"
108,18,"      and Empowerment Programme in Sierra Leone. In Sri Lanka, participants in a"
108,19,"      public works program assisting more than 250,000 returnees noted that the"
108,20,"      program meetings were the first community-level gathering they had attended"
108,21,"      after having arrived from internally displaced person camps. By many accounts,"
108,22,"      community meetings, shared meals, teamwork, and the involvement of elders"
108,23,"      and children as indirect program beneficiaries promoted a sense of belonging"
108,24,"      among the newly resettled families. Relatedly, effects on the social fabric of"
108,25,"      communities and their empowerment was documented in public works pro-"
108,26,"      grams in Zambia and Peru. Other externalities (often unintended) have been"
108,27,"      observed in terms of climate mitigation and carbon benefits (e.g., Ethiopia’s"
108,28,"      Managing Environmental Resources to Enable Transition to More Sustainable"
108,29,"      Livelihoods [MERET]9 and Productive Safety Net Programme programs)."
108,30,"   •• Provision of services. This approach does not necessarily entail heavy labor-in-"
108,31,"      tensive activities; instead, it provides temporary jobs in realms like child care,"
108,32,"      old-age assistance, service at social centers (e.g., soup kitchens, orphanages),"
108,33,"      and other services. Programs such as Kinofelis in Greece and part of South Afri-"
108,34,"      ca’s Expanded Public Works Programs have been moving in this direction."
108,35,"   •• Enhancing employability: increasing the likelihood of job market entry via public"
108,36,"      works–plus. This model includes public works programs combined with other"
108,37,"      active labor market policies. Their overall likelihood of enhancing employability"
108,38,"      by imparting skills rests on several assumptions: unemployment includes a fric-"
108,39,"      tional element, with supply-side constraints representing a key bottleneck; there"
108,40,"      are reasonable prospects of economic recovery and/or the imminent expansion"
108,41,"      of labor demand; there is matching capacity to identify and tailor skills to ben-"
108,42,"      eficiaries’ profiles; trainings are effectively delivered and post-training feedback"
108,43,
109,1,"Chapter 2. UBI as Social Assistance: Comparative Models and Instruments                       85"
109,2,"          loops are established. One example is El Salvador’s Programa de Apoyo Tempo-"
109,3,"          ral al Ingreso targeting high-violence urban areas (Gentilini 2015)."
109,4,"       The performance of public works overall has been widely documented (GIZ 2019;"
109,5,"McCord 2012; Subbarao et al. 2013). With the exception of the NREGS in India and the Pro-"
109,6,"ductive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia, public works are not being assessed against their"
109,7,"full potential—for example, there could be benefits that persist beyond the duration of the"
109,8,"program (e.g., in terms of assets created) that are not currently captured by empirical studies."
109,9,"       In terms of provision of income, public works programs are often self-targeted by the"
109,10,"requirement to work for low(ish) wages. Since almost all programs have budgets far more lim-"
109,11,"ited than the number of workers willing to work for such wages, they usually also have other"
109,12,"targeting devices—by rationing the number of days each worker can work, by age or geogra-"
109,13,"phy, by some sort of assessment of poverty, or even by lotteries, such as in the Central African"
109,14,"Republic (Alik-Lagrange and Bance 2019). Such rationing makes these programs targeted,"
109,15,"while manual labor requirements could imply missing disabled or higher-skilled workers."
109,16,"       In general, the progressivity of benefits in public works programs is less than for"
109,17,"poverty-targeted cash transfer programs. In 9 out of 10 programs with results available,"
109,18,"fewer than 40 percent of the beneficiaries were in the poorest quintile (World Bank"
109,19,"2018). Wages paid are not all net income gain to the household, as often participation in"
109,20,"the public works displaces some labor from other activities. Subbarao et al. (2013) show"
109,21,"net wage gains of about half of gross for Bangladesh and India; about 80 percent for Ethi-"
109,22,"opia, Liberia, and Niger; and even higher for Sierra Leone."
109,23,"Wage Subsidy Programs"
109,24,"Wage subsidies are direct transfers to employers/firms or individual workers to cover"
109,25,"wages in full or in part (Almeida, Orr, and Robalino 2014; Bördős, Csillag, and Scharle"
109,26,"2015; Gentilini 2018b; Kluve et al. 2016). The main aim is to incentivize existing firms"
109,27,"to either increase employment or retain employees who might otherwise be laid off for"
109,28,"economic reasons. In those contexts, wage subsidies can represent a risk discount to"
109,29,"compensate employers for the potential lower productivity or perceived risks inherent in"
109,30,"hiring people with the above profiles."
109,31,"       Wage subsidies present a range of possible benefits. These can be clustered around"
109,32,"the following four:"
109,33,"       •• Revealed information. The period of subsidized work can act as a screening"
109,34,"          device, providing direct information on productivity."
109,35,"       •• Direct work experience and skills acquisition. Subsidized employment can promote"
109,36,"          skill formation through on-the-job learning, leading to increased productivity"
109,37,"          and subsequent improvement in employment prospects over the longer term."
109,38,"       •• Employment probability. Awareness of eligibility might change the (eligible) work-"
109,39,"          ers’ market perception of success rates and increase job-search efforts, which"
109,40,"          may also increase employment probability."
109,41,
110,1,"86                                                            Ugo Gentilini and Margaret Grosh"
110,2,"       •• Quality alignment. By influencing certain work or career paths, people can target"
110,3,"          more suitable opportunities in their subsequent job searches. This “job ladder"
110,4,"          effect” can improve the quality of future job matches. (In contrast, if workers"
110,5,"          accept less suitable jobs in the absence of the subsidy, this can create a trap and"
110,6,"          harm their career paths in terms of future employment prospects or earnings.)"
110,7,"       Clearly, wage subsidies present a gamut of risks and limitations. A core one is dead-"
110,8,"weight: in such a case, the subsidy may support a share of eligible workers who would have"
110,9,"been hired in any case, regardless of whether subsidies were offered; this is also known as"
110,10,"windfall wastage. Another risk is substitution: while hiring subsidized workers, firms may"
110,11,"lay off ineligible workers who have similar characteristics and can be substituted by eligible"
110,12,"workers (i.e., no rise in overall employment, but an internal firm reshuffling)."
110,13,"       Displacement and stigma are two other risks. In the case of displacement,"
110,14,"increases in employment among firms absorbing subsidized labor might generate job"
110,15,"losses among firms not benefiting from such a cost advantage. Stigma can occur when"
110,16,"firms view the targeted subsidy as an indication of an employee’s low productivity and,"
110,17,"contrary to intent, they avoid hiring from the group of those eligible. Alternatively, the"
110,18,"targeted workers themselves may feel that eligibility is stigmatizing and may try to con-"
110,19,"ceal their eligibility status."
110,20,"       Establishing conditions is one way of minimizing the risks and limiting unintended"
110,21,"behavioral responses by firms (hence hampering the effectiveness of hiring subsidies)."
110,22,"But there is a trade-off between the additional costs incurred due to deadweight and"
110,23,"substitution effects and reduced effectiveness due to low take-up. Indeed, conditions"
110,24,"might reduce risks, but also increase the administrative burden and compliance costs for"
110,25,"firms, reducing the potential benefits of the subsidy for employers. The extent of these"
110,26,"costs is difficult to quantify, as different types of employers might weight them differ-"
110,27,"ently. The devising of conditions is a fundamental parameter that, alongside other key"
110,28,"considerations such as subsidy generosity (size), can significantly tilt overall program"
110,29,"performance,10 especially in terms of firms’ take-up rates (box 2.1)."
110,30,"Tax-Based Programs Based on Work"
110,31,"The EITC is perceived as occupying a middle ground between a tax and transfer status—a"
110,32,"tax program in administrative terms, but largely a poverty-oriented social assistance pro-"
110,33,"gram in conceptual justification and economic effects. It may be thought of as the real-life"
110,34,"approximation to NIT. Contrary to the pure NIT and to the UBI (and to many other social"
110,35,"assistance programs), it deliberately ties benefits to labor force participation and earnings."
110,36,"       Introduced in 1975, the United States’ EITC program was a pioneer, engineered to"

112,31,"cannot or do not work, and benefits are extremely limited to those without children (97 per-"
112,32,"cent of recipients have at least one child). Reviews of empirical evidence suggest that the"
112,33,"credit increased employment rates of single mothers—one of the groups with higher elastic-"
112,34,"ity of labor force participation—between 2 and 10 percentage points. The literature, however,"
112,35,"is less settled on how much the EITC affects work intensity, or hours of work."
112,36,"        The main advantages of an EITC include the following: it is politically attractive as it"
112,37,"rewards work, it is relatively “off the radar” for attacks, incidence is progressive, and work-"
112,38,"ing through the tax authority makes it easier to administer and may be less stigmatizing."
112,39,"Conversely, its main limitations involve the following: it only reaches taxpayers, who tend"
112,40,"to be formal wage earners. This would largely leave out informal workers, the self-em-"
112,41,"ployed, those not filing taxes, etc., which would be a very large share of the poor population"
112,42,"in developing countries. Working through the tax authority makes it more difficult to link to"
112,43,"other programs and activation. It requires credible and efficient tax administration, tax tri-"
112,44,"bunals, and a dispute resolution system. And when paid annually, as in the United States,"
112,45,"an EITC is of less use in meeting recurrent living expenses such as food and shelter."
112,46,"Conclusions"
112,47,"There are many objectives and features embedded in social assistance. These closely"
112,48,"mirror the framework laid out in this book’s overview: for example, social assistance"
112,49,"can be intended to cover everyone who needs support; to provide adequate transfers to"
112,50,"households or individuals; to be manageable to finance and administer; to garner suf-"
112,51,"ficient societal consensus to maintain political support; and to create as many positive"
112,52,"and as few negative side effects as possible. There are tensions among these objectives,"
112,53,
113,1,"Chapter 2. UBI as Social Assistance: Comparative Models and Instruments                     89"
113,2,"and no program scores highly on all of them. The trade-offs and difficult balance across"
113,3,"dimensions account for part of why social assistance is so varied in different contexts,"
113,4,"and why it remains an ongoing area of fervent debate."
113,5,"       The idea of a UBI is a possible new entry point to build social protection systems."
113,6,"Yet what exactly a UBI is remains contested. For example, Italy’s recent Citizens’ Income,"
113,7,"initially hailed as a UBI, is instead a GMI program, and one conditioned on work. The"
113,8,"broad application of the term “UBI” to a wide array of different schemes may not only"
113,9,"increase semantic confusion, but also obscure the actual comparative advantages—and"
113,10,"limitations—that specific options bring to the table. In a way, the misalignment between"
113,11,"what a program is called and what it is in practice may reduce the space for informed policy"
113,12,"discussions around how to best achieve intended objectives with the instruments at hand."
113,13,"       By reviewing the core parameters of a suite of social assistance interventions, this"
113,14,"chapter aims to elucidate the differences between a UBI and other possible instruments."
113,15,"We discuss the traits of different programmatic choices with the view of better inform-"
113,16,"ing the debate through precision in definition, specificity in objectives, and clarity on the"
113,17,"relative merits of different programs in pursuing them."
113,18,"       The discussion around alternative social assistance programs is largely one around"
113,19,"charting the benefits curve—that is, the reach and steepness of the benefit structure"
113,20,"across the income distribution. Such steepness ranges from being flat (in UBI and cate-"
113,21,"gorical programs) to being quite sharp in GMI models. It is extensive in reach (or coverage)"
113,22,"for UBI- and categorical NIT-type programs, and less so for other interventions. The exact"
113,23,"contours of the benefit structure would hinge upon program objectives and contextual"
113,24,"variables such as the funding envelope."
113,25,"       Some of the reviewed programs operate via the tax code, such as the NIT and the"
113,26,"EITC, thus presenting features that may not be easily applicable to contexts with large"
113,27,"informality. However, even in programs in lower-income countries that are managed by"
113,28,"social protection authorities, such as a prospective UBI, taxation is too often not consid-"
113,29,"ered as part of the debate. As we discuss in chapters 4 and 5, if financing includes direct or"
113,30,"indirect taxation instead of—for example—subsidy reforms or fiscal consolidation, some"
113,31,"citizens will be net receivers and other net payers of a UBI. In other words, a UBI could"
113,32,"become a targeted scheme via taxes. Targeting is therefore not necessarily an alien feature"
113,33,"in a UBI—both in tax terms and categorically (a UBI may be limited to adults, for instance)."
113,34,"       Societal preferences and attitudes toward redistribution may also influence whether"
113,35,"programs should be based on co-responsibilities in general, and on work in particular."
113,36,"The emergence of JGPs extends the debate on the UBI from one of universality in income"
113,37,"to one on universality in jobs. This, in turn, involves a host of other issues that span"
113,38,"across the supply and demand sides of labor markets—how to generate good jobs—"
113,39,"whereas the UBI is only a slice of the bigger pie (pertaining to the supply side). Chapter 3"
113,40,"discusses more extensively the relationship between UBI and employment."
113,41,"       As noted in chapter 1, one of the core challenges of UBI will be to manage expec-"
113,42,"tations. To this effect, it will be critical to anchor UBI debates to a clear definition of"
113,43,"program design, a crisp articulation of objectives, and how the UBI is expected to per-"
113,44,"form better than alternatives relative to those objectives."

116,2,"Notes"
116,3,"1.  We here include four options related to wage employment. Programs for self-employment"
116,4,"    tend to provide one-off payments, which are conceptually and technically different."
116,5,"2.  Short-term age-based grants are paid for a limited period of the life course (e.g., ages 0–2 in"
116,6,"    Belarus, and 0–3 in Ukraine); in other cases, programs that exclude high-income households"
116,7,"    are known as affluence-tested schemes, which cover the large majority of the population"
116,8,"    including middle-class households (e.g., Mongolia); finally, a coordinated mixed scheme com-"
116,9,"    bines social insurance and tax-financed provision. Among the 14 quasi-universal child grants,"
116,10,"    four countries (e.g., Japan) combine social insurance and noncontributory targeted/means-"
116,11,"    tested schemes (ILO and UNICEF 2019)."
116,12,"3.  For a contemporary political economy analysis of how social protection spread across Africa,"
116,13,"    see Hickey et al. (forthcoming)."
116,14,"4.  Similar trajectories are observed for the long-term effects of conditional cash transfers in"
116,15,"    Malawi (Baird, McIntosh, and Özler 2019)."
116,16,"5.  These star states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,"
116,17,"    Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarkhand."
116,18,"6.  However, Zimmermann (2013) finds no significant impact of the NREGS on public sector"
116,19,"    employment or private sector wages, comparing Phase 2 to Phase 3 districts."
116,20,"7.  A similar large-scale program is the Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Programme, which oper-"
116,21,"    ates for six months of the year. While maintaining a safety net spirit, the program’s permanent"
116,22,"    nature and longer-term duration make it distinct from other crisis-response, short-term design"
116,23,"    options."
116,24,"8.  The program’s objectives were to provide temporary opportunities as well as training and"
116,25,"    apprenticeships for long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons. Projects were also"
116,26,"    used to reintegrate former drug addicts into the labor market. In 1998, the scheme had"
116,27,"    43,000 participants engaged in two part-time activities: (1) an integration option offers ongo-"
116,28,"    ing employment for people over age 25 who have received social welfare payments for over"
116,29,"    a year (or those over age 18 on disability); and (2) an option for up to six years of work was"
116,30,"    devised for those over age 35 who have been on social welfare for three years or more. Evalu-"
116,31,"    ations show that if the public works are considered as supply-side measures to move workers"
116,32,"    into regular employment, then the Community Employment Programme had been relatively"
116,33,"    unsuccessful; on the other hand, if they are considered demand-side measures designed to"
116,34,"    create aggregate employment, the program can be considered a success."
116,35,"9.  MERET is a government-led public works program adopting a community-based watershed"
116,36,"    management approach; it provided important lessons informing Productive Safety Net Pro-"
116,37,"    gramme design in the mid-2000s."
116,38,"10. There are several critical design parameters to consider in wage subsidy planning. For instance,"
116,39,"    an important choice is around the payee, or whether the wage subsidy is to be paid to the"
116,40,"    employer or the worker (vouchers). The target profile of beneficiaries would entail various"
116,41,"    choices (e.g., incumbents or new hires). As to subsidy size and structure, the benefit should"
116,42,"    be large enough to make it attractive for the employer to hire the worker. The target group and"
116,43,"    related objectives matter for design. For subsidies that aim to promote all youth employment,"
116,44,"    it is sensible to define the subsidy proportional to wages. However, if the goal is integration"
116,45,"    of disadvantaged youth, then setting a maximum threshold for the subsidy or defining it as"
116,46,
117,1,"Chapter 2. UBI as Social Assistance: Comparative Models and Instruments                              93"
117,2,"     a fixed amount can be effective, since this will tilt the employer’s incentives toward hiring"
117,3,"     the lowest-wage workers (i.e., it may offset a larger proportion of their earnings). Moreover,"
117,4,"     it might be appropriate to reduce the subsidy over time since productivity will increase with"
117,5,"     experience, and hence the need to subsidize wages might decline alongside the gap between"
117,6,"     minimum wage and workers’ productivity. The duration of the subsidy must be carefully cal-"
117,7,"     ibrated to the objectives: short-term subsidies (six months or less) are appropriate in case of"
117,8,"     unknown productivity of the worker. Medium-term and longer subsidy periods (from nine"
117,9,"     months to two years) can permit young workers to develop necessary skills, and as a result"
117,10,"     increase their productivity. Subsidization beyond this learning-by-doing period tends to be"
117,11,"     cost ineffective as it leads to deadweight losses. Long-term subsidies are rare and are only"
117,12,"     used for target groups with multiple disadvantages (e.g., low-skilled, long-term unemployed,"
117,13,"     and health impaired)."
117,14,"11. For example, during the climbing phase-in stage, a person with one child receives US$0.34"
117,15,"     in EITC benefits for every additional dollar of earnings. After the plateau, the credit declines"
117,16,"     for each dollar of earnings at a stable rate (almost 16 percent), until it tapers out entirely. In"
117,17,"     2017, the maximum credit was US$3,400 for a family with one child, US$5,616 for those"
117,18,"     with two children, and US$6,318 for those with three or more children. In contrast, child-"
117,19,"     less workers could receive no more than US$510. Also, the income cap for childless workers"
117,20,"     is much lower. They receive no EITC if their income exceeds US$15,010 (US$20,600 if mar-"
117,21,"     ried), while workers with three or more children may have incomes as high as US$39,617"
117,22,"     (US$45,207 if married) before they lose the benefit. In most cases, EITC recipients do not owe"
117,23,"     federal income taxes, so they receive the credit as a lump sum in the spring when they file"
117,24,"     their annual tax returns. This annual payment is in tension with the objective of supporting"
117,25,"     the day-to-day expenses of poor households. There are state-level EITCs in 23 states. Since the"
117,26,"     information needed to calculate the state credit is supplied on the federal tax form, adminis-"
117,27,"     tration at the state level is relatively easy."

123,3,"Francesca Bastagli"
123,4,"T"
123,5,"        he recent rise in interest in universal basic income (UBI) reflects a growing con-"
123,6,"        cern that the economy and existing welfare policies are failing to deliver for parts"
123,7,"        of the population. In the world of work, the rise in nonstandard employment and"
123,8,"        work insecurity, high informality, and the threat of technological unemployment"
123,9,"highlight the limitations of existing policies. Other challenges and shortcomings are not"
123,10,"new. For instance, assumptions about gendered roles commonly underpinning social"
123,11,"protection schemes have historically resulted in higher exclusion from social protection"
123,12,"and weaker provision for women compared to men, in many cases reinforcing gender"
123,13,"inequalities in the world of work."
123,14,"      One of the main achievements of this recent renewed interest in UBI is that it has"
123,15,"thrown open questions that, in some circles at least, had been considered closed. These"
123,16,"range from fundamental questions about the nature and value of work, to the role of the"
123,17,"regulation of labor relations, to the specifics of how a UBI could address the limitations"
123,18,"and unintended effects of existing social protection schemes. In terms of conceptualiza-"
123,19,"tion, the UBI debate questions the near-exclusive focus (in both research and policy) on"
123,20,"paid work and financial incentives, and brings back to the fore the issues of type and"
123,21,"quality of work. In terms of policy design and implementation choices, the debate ques-"
123,22,"tions how alternative options—for instance, concerning targeting and conditionality and"
123,23,"treatment unit (individual or household)—influence work outcomes."
123,24,"      Against this backdrop, this chapter explores key questions the UBI debate raises"
123,25,"with respect to what are commonly labeled “behavioral” individual- and household-level"
123,26,"work outcomes: Would a UBI lead to reductions in people’s participation in paid work? By"
123,27,"providing workers with an exit option and strengthened bargaining power, could it lead to"
123,28,"                                              99"
123,29,
124,1,"100                                                                          Francesca Bastagli"
124,2,"improved conditions of paid work? Could a UBI free up time to take on work that is unpaid"
124,3,"but valued by individuals and society? By weakening incentives to formalization, would a"
124,4,"UBI contribute to a rise in informal work? Based on a review of both theoretical arguments"
124,5,"and available evidence, the chapter aims to contribute to this lively and welcome debate."
124,6,"       More specifically, the chapter explores claims about how the defining features of"
124,7,"a UBI—its universal, unconditional, individual nature and periodic payments (Van Parijs"
124,8,"2004)—influence work outcomes. It pays special attention to the role played by varia-"
124,9,"tions in proposed UBI schemes, for instance, concerning the level of the basic income"
124,10,"and a scheme’s articulation within broader social and labor market policy. By avoiding"
124,11,"targeting and conditionality, by essentially divorcing eligibility for social protection trans-"
124,12,"fers from any labor contribution, a UBI could influence work outcomes differently than"
124,13,"alternative cash transfer schemes. Similarly, a UBI’s payments to individuals rather than"
124,14,"households are expected to make a difference. Such issues are explored here, with refer-"
124,15,"ence to both theory and practice. As this chapter highlights, and to no surprise, variations"
124,16,"in the details of program design and a scheme’s positioning within wider social and labor"
124,17,"policy are key determinants of policy outcomes."
124,18,"The Arguments"
124,19,"Four broad sets of work-related outcomes are covered here:"
124,20,"       •• Participation in paid work and financial work incentives. UBI critics warn that"
124,21,"          the unearned income from a UBI would lead people to work less. Compared"
124,22,"          to transfers with work conditions and job search and training requirements, a"
124,23,"          UBI would additionally weaken people’s participation in paid work. At the same"
124,24,"          time, compared to a means-tested cash transfer, the universal nature of the UBI"
124,25,"          could weaken the work disincentive generated by a means test, especially when"
124,26,"          the latter displays a high marginal tax rate or benefit withdrawal rate. Concerns"
124,27,"          about people reducing their time in paid work as a result of additional unearned"
124,28,"          income imply this is a negative outcome. As highlighted by the UBI debate, and"
124,29,"          discussed further below, such a result could in fact be linked to increased indi-"
124,30,"          vidual and societal welfare."
124,31,"       •• Conditions of paid work. UBI advocates argue that guaranteeing everyone an"
124,32,"          unconditional income floor potentially enables workers to turn down insecure,"
124,33,"          low-paid, exploitative work or demand improved work conditions by granting"
124,34,"          them an exit option from such work or employment relations. Conversely, con-"
124,35,"          cerns are raised that a UBI could act as a subsidy to low wages and make low"
124,36,"          pay more acceptable. A UBI could promote casual work and job insecurity by"
124,37,"          increasing the supply of labor for insecure jobs."
124,38,"       •• Valuation and distribution of unpaid work. Much of the discussion on cash trans-"
124,39,"          fers and work incentives focuses on paid work and the concern that a UBI could"
124,40,
125,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                               101"
125,2,"         reduce incentives to take up or spend more time in paid employment. However,"
125,3,"         this misses the consideration that a UBI could free up time to take up work that"
125,4,"         is unpaid, including work that may be valuable to society or the individual, but is"
125,5,"         not recognized as such in terms of monetary compensation in the labor market."
125,6,"         In the case of domestic and care work, still disproportionately carried out by"
125,7,"         women and girls, advocates argue that a UBI could support its redistribution"
125,8,"         between the sexes. At the same time, critics warn a UBI would reinforce the gen-"
125,9,"         dered division of work, for instance, by increasing the incentive for women to"
125,10,"         reduce their participation in paid work given their relatively weaker attachment"
125,11,"         to the labor market compared to men."
125,12,"      •• Formal and informal work. The universal and unconditional nature of a UBI weak-"
125,13,"         ens the link between labor market status and social protection entitlements. As"
125,14,"         such, it could weaken the incentive to move toward formal employment. In the"
125,15,"         case of means-tested and conditional noncontributory cash transfers, beneficia-"
125,16,"         ries’ perceptions that they could lose their transfer entitlement by working may"
125,17,"         generate an incentive to stay in or take up informal work, avoiding “visible”"
125,18,"         work. The universal and unconditional nature of a UBI could weaken concerns"
125,19,"         that formal work could lead to loss of benefit eligibility."
125,20,"The Nature of the Evidence"
125,21,"The limited implementation of full UBI schemes to date means there is limited direct"
125,22,"empirical evidence of the implications of a UBI for the outcomes of interest here."
125,23,"Although this poses a challenge, this chapter maintains there is much to be learned of"
125,24,"direct relevance to the UBI debate from the experience of other cash transfers, includ-"
125,25,"ing basic income–type experiments, negative income tax schemes, as well as targeted"
125,26,"and conditional cash transfers. The chapter reviews available evidence arising from the"
125,27,"implementation of UBI schemes, such as the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend and the"
125,28,"Islamic Republic of Iran’s Price Subsidy Reform; from negative income tax schemes,"
125,29,"including the 1960s–80s experiments in the United States and Canada; and from tar-"
125,30,"geted and conditional cash transfers worldwide (see also chapter 4). Throughout, in"
125,31,"recognition of the variety of UBI proposals in practice and of the degrees of targeting and"
125,32,"types of conditionality adopted, special attention is paid to identifying how differences"
125,33,"in such design and implementation parameters influence work outcomes."
125,34,"      Two qualifying points need to be made with regard to the evidence and how it is"
125,35,"interpreted. First, as mentioned above, the majority of experiments and pilots that are"
125,36,"labeled as “basic income” generally do not comply even with the fundamental core"
125,37,"parameters of a UBI outlined above (e.g., unconditional, no means test, individual). For"
125,38,"example, the majority of basic income pilots and experiments have elements of tar-"
125,39,"geting. The negative income tax experiments in Canada and the United States in the"
125,40,"1960s–80s had an income-related eligibility threshold (Hum and Simpson 1993). They"
125,41,
126,1,"102                                                                        Francesca Bastagli"
126,2,"also mostly focused on particular family structures (e.g., families with two children) and"
126,3,"particular ages. In the contemporary Ontario pilot, only those earning less than the full"
126,4,"value of the basic income payments are eligible for the scheme (Young 2018). The recent"
126,5,"Finnish partial basic income experiment (January 2017–December 2018) paid a transfer"
126,6,"solely to the unemployed, specifically those who were in receipt of unemployment ben-"
126,7,"efits prior to the experiment (Kangas et al. 2019)."
126,8,"       Second, conversely, cash transfers that are not considered to share much with a"
126,9,"UBI may actually have some commonalities as a result of design and implementation"
126,10,"details. A case in point is provided by means-tested conditional and unconditional cash"
126,11,"transfers across low- and middle-income countries. In some cases, even when a transfer"
126,12,"has a clear income-related eligibility threshold, delays or failure to recertify and update"
126,13,"information over time lead to a delinking of changes in beneficiaries’ circumstances with"
126,14,"transfer receipt, in practice weakening the targeting element of the scheme."
126,15,"       This is not a systematic review. However, every effort is made to include the results"
126,16,"from relevant rigorous studies, including ones that estimate policy impact via counter-"
126,17,"factual analysis relying on experimental or quasi-experimental approaches as well as"
126,18,"qualitative studies relying on smaller samples of respondents (e.g., to capture informa-"
126,19,"tion on process and perceptions on outcomes of interest that may not be covered by"
126,20,"counterfactual analyses)."
126,21,"       This chapter mostly focuses on evidence from micro-, individual-, and house-"
126,22,"hold-level analysis of the impact of cash transfers. For the limited number of studies"
126,23,"available on UBI schemes (mostly the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend), it reports any"
126,24,"available evidence on aggregate measures such as state-level wage rates and number of"
126,25,"employed. Since the universal nature of a UBI poses a challenge to identifying individu-"
126,26,"al-level effects via counterfactual analysis, available studies rely on aggregate measures."
126,27,"       Finally, the chapter covers schemes in low-, middle-, and high-income countries."
126,28,"Variations in the labor markets (e.g., share of unemployed, self-employed) and finan-"
126,29,"cial markets across these countries are significant and have implications for the barriers"
126,30,"and opportunities faced by individuals, which in turn shape the effects of cash trans-"
126,31,"fers. Throughout, attention is paid to context and how this influences the impact of cash"
126,32,"transfers on work-related outcomes."
126,33,"Participation in Paid Work and Financial"
126,34,"Work Incentives"
126,35,"Much of the debate on UBI and work is framed in terms of work incentives, with a"
126,36,"focus on paid work and financial incentives. Cash transfers paid directly to individuals or"
126,37,"households are commonly criticized for giving rise to adverse incentive effects, contrib-"
126,38,"uting to unemployment and slack economic growth (e.g., on Europe, see Immervoll and"
126,39,"O’Donoghue 2002). Standard economic theory predicts that the additional unearned"
126,40,"income via a cash transfer will negatively affect people’s participation in paid work"
126,41,
127,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                                103"
127,2,"(extensive margin) and number of hours worked (intensive margin) via a direct income"
127,3,"effect. The additional unearned income would permit recipients to spend the extra"
127,4,"income on activities other than paid work. Furthermore, elements of targeting and con-"
127,5,"ditionality in a cash transfer may affect labor supply via a substitution effect. In the case"
127,6,"of means testing, for example, the income or asset eligibility threshold may generate an"
127,7,"incentive for people to maintain their incomes/assets below such a level in order to qual-"
127,8,"ify for a transfer—for instance, by reducing their work effort (Atkinson 1995)."
127,9,"       Compared with targeted schemes, a UBI paid to all could in principle strengthen the"
127,10,"income effect by extending coverage to those not receiving means-tested transfers. In"
127,11,"principle, a UBI additionally weakens the link to the labor market provided by conditional-"
127,12,"ities on work participation. Indeed, the introduction of conditionality in the form of work"
127,13,"requirements for cash transfer recipients and related in-work benefit reforms in countries"
127,14,"such as the United Kingdom and the United States was motivated by work incentive and"
127,15,"labor supply concerns. Policy developments in these countries in the 1990s, and again"
127,16,"more recently, focused on increasing participation in paid work among cash transfer"
127,17,"recipients and claimants through the introduction of work requirements and welfare-to-"
127,18,"work reforms (e.g., see Blundell and Macurdy 1999; Brewer 2003; Moffitt 2002). At the"
127,19,"same time, a UBI paid to everyone would weaken the work disincentive effect generated"
127,20,"by means testing, potentially supporting an increase in work participation."
127,21,"       A cash transfer’s effect on participation in paid work is expected to vary depend-"
127,22,"ing on individual characteristics and by population subgroup. The income effect may"
127,23,"be strong for those with weak labor market attachment and/or low earning potential. In"
127,24,"couples, and in the case of cash transfers means tested at the household level, individu-"
127,25,"als whose partners earn relatively high wages may face high disincentives as additional"
127,26,"work effort could disqualify them from transfers means tested at the household level."
127,27,"Critically, cash transfer design details—such as whether transfers are paid at the individ-"
127,28,"ual or household level, as just mentioned, and the level of the transfer—are expected"
127,29,"to matter, with a generous transfer potentially associated with higher work disincentive"
127,30,"effects."
127,31,"       Concerns about the potential negative impact of UBIs/cash transfers on participa-"
127,32,"tion in paid work are commonly based on a number of assumptions. Three of these,"
127,33,"discussed briefly here, provide examples of why we may observe departures from what"
127,34,"standard economic theory predicts in empirical investigations of the effects of cash"
127,35,"transfers on participation in paid work. First, there is typically an underlying assumption"
127,36,"of functioning labor and financial/credit markets. In practice, however, contexts are often"
127,37,"ones in which markets for financial services and labor are difficult to access or do not"
127,38,"function well. Particularly in such contexts, we could expect that the regular additional"
127,39,"income of a cash transfer would help tackle barriers to work and productive investments"
127,40,"that affect people’s work opportunities and ability to work (Banerjee et al. 2015; Bastagli"
127,41,"et al. 2016). Second, the focus on financial work incentives tends to omit that there are"
127,42,"of course other dimensions to cash that will be equally or more relevant for decisions"
127,43,"of whether to seek or stay in paid work—among them, nonfinancial rewards. Third,"
127,44,"a common assumption is that policy implementation follows on directly from policy"
127,45,
128,1,"104                                                                         Francesca Bastagli"
128,2,"design; for instance, a transfer displaying a high marginal tax rate by design will lead"
128,3,"to one in practice. However, policy implementation may depart from policy design, and"
128,4,"such departures may play an important role in shaping impact in practice."
128,5,"       Results from studies of two UBI schemes implemented to date—Alaska’s Perma-"
128,6,"nent Fund Dividend and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s cash transfer—yield evidence on"
128,7,"the labor supply effects of such transfers. They find that overall, the regular payment of"
128,8,"a universal cash transfer does not lead to a significant impact on participation in paid"
128,9,"work. There is some evidence for Alaska of an increase in part-time work associated"
128,10,"with the dividend. For population subgroups for which a reduction in participation in"
128,11,"paid work was recorded (specifically, Iranian youth), this was linked to a shift in time use"
128,12,"toward other valued activities. Overall, the available evidence suggests that an uncondi-"
128,13,"tional income floor generated no general significant disincentive to work."
128,14,"       For the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, all available studies report effects on"
128,15,"aggregate employment measures (e.g., state-level wage rates, number of employed and"
128,16,"unemployed, early retirement rates).1 Jones and Marinescu (2018) use data from states"
128,17,"that match Alaska in terms of outcomes of interest to study the impact of the dividend"
128,18,"on employment-to-population ratios. They find the employment rates in the state match"
128,19,"those of the control states. However, the share of Alaskans working part time increased"
128,20,"by 2 percentage points, indicating that the dividend led to an intensive margin response:"
128,21,"people worked less hours given the additional income. Earlier studies look at compara-"
128,22,"tive trends in aggregate state-level wage rates, the number of employed and unemployed,"
128,23,"and early retirement (Goldsmith 2010, 2012). They find no or limited reported reduc-"
128,24,"tions in time spent in paid employment and no evidence of impact on early retirement,"
128,25,"as labor force participation has continued to trend upward despite the growth of num-"
128,26,"bers of people age 65 and over (Goldsmith 2012)."
128,27,"       The researchers attribute these findings for Alaska’s UBI to two factors: the compar-"
128,28,"atively low value of the transfer and the potential for the macro effects of the dividend"
128,29,"to have countered the scheme’s income effects. The potential income effect is balanced"
128,30,"by the macro effect, whereby any decrease in the labor supply would increase the equi-"
128,31,"librium wage rate; in turn, the dividend increases consumption, which stimulates labor"
128,32,"demand, thus increasing wages and employment (Goldsmith 2012; Jones and Marinescu"
128,33,"2018)."
128,34,"       A study of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s universal cash transfer (Salehi-Isfahani and"
128,35,"Mostafavi-Dehzooei 2017) examines its impact on labor force participation and hours"
128,36,"of work by Iranian men and women. It finds that the UBI does not result in a negative"
128,37,"labor supply effect for either hours worked or the probability of participation in market"
128,38,"work, either for all workers or those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribu-"
128,39,"tion. However, they do find a negative effect on the number of hours worked for workers"
128,40,"20–29 years old. The authors reflect that this is likely due to the weak attachment of Ira-"
128,41,"nian youth to the labor market and the option for many to enroll in tertiary and graduate"
128,42,"education."
128,43,"       The U.S. and Canadian guaranteed income experiments of the 1960s–80s explic-"
128,44,"itly tested the labor supply effects of negative income taxes.2 Overall, the experiments"
128,45,
129,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                                 105"
129,2,"find evidence of no effects or moderate reductions in work participation in some cases."
129,3,"Where the latter were recorded, reduction rates were higher for women. According"
129,4,"to Burtless’s review of the results of studies from the four U.S. experiments, the only"
129,5,"consistently negative and statistically significant result arises from the Seattle-Den-"
129,6,"ver experiment, with the highest average generosity of transfer (Burtless 1986).3 The"
129,7,"Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment (Mincome) in Canada recorded a modest"
129,8,"reduction in number of hours worked—1 percent for men, 3 percent for wives, and"
129,9,"5 percent for unmarried women—which is statistically insignificant when time effects"
129,10,"are controlled for (Hum and Simpson 1993)."
129,11,"       In sum, the negative income tax experiments find few adverse effects and no"
129,12,"evidence of high numbers of workers reducing their work effort; this suggests that an"
129,13,"unconditional income floor delivered as a negative income tax generated no or a moder-"
129,14,"ate disincentive to work. Where reductions in work effort were recorded, these may have"
129,15,"been the result of people’s improved balancing of work and home lives/paid and unpaid"
129,16,"work and a shift in time use toward other valued activities (e.g., as reflected in results for"
129,17,"women’s reductions in participation in paid work), leading potentially to increased indi-"
129,18,"vidual and societal welfare (Widerquist 2005)."
129,19,"       These studies do not allow us to draw conclusions about the extent to which the"
129,20,"absence of a clear and significant effect on participation in paid work is the result of"
129,21,"the universal and unconditional nature of the UBI and negative income tax. Empiri-"
129,22,"cal investigations into the labor supply effects of targeted and/or conditional transfers"
129,23,"provide some indication of the role of such features in influencing work participation"
129,24,"outcomes."
129,25,"       A common approach to empirical investigations of a cash transfer’s potential work"
129,26,"(dis)incentive effect relies on measures such as the participation tax rate (measures"
129,27,"the proportion of gross earnings lost through tax and/or benefit withdrawal) and the"
129,28,"marginal effective tax rate (measures the propor­tion of each additional unit of earned"
129,29,"income lost to tax and/or benefit withdrawal). Such measures provide an indication of"
129,30,"a transfer’s potential work incentive effects. High participation tax rates and marginal"
129,31,"effective tax rates describe circumstances in which people face little financial incentive"
129,32,"to take on paid work or work longer hours (Atkinson 1995; Immervoll and O’Donoghue"
129,33,"2002; Martinelli 2017)."
129,34,"       One of the potential advantages of a UBI is that it avoids the disincentive effects"
129,35,"associated with means testing and benefit withdrawal as captured in marginal tax rate"
129,36,"and participation tax rate measures. In both the United Kingdom and the United States,"
129,37,"studies indicating the high marginal tax rates generated by means-tested schemes and"
129,38,"related concerns for potential negative labor supply effects contributed to the introduc-"
129,39,"tion of work requirements and time limits such as those introduced in the 1990s to"
129,40,"the U.S. Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, the country’s main means-"
129,41,"tested cash transfer paid mostly to single-mother families (Moffitt 2002). Now known as"
129,42,"the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the scheme requires recipients to work a"
129,43,"minimum number of hours per week and includes benefit reduction penalties if these"
129,44,"requirements are not met, including termination from the program."
129,45,
130,1,"106                                                                        Francesca Bastagli"
130,2,"      The expansion of targeted (mostly means-tested or proxy means–tested) cash"
130,3,"transfers over the last two decades in countries worldwide was accompanied by a flurry"
130,4,"of impact evaluations examining work and labor supply effects. Based on recent sys-"
130,5,"tematic reviews, the evidence indicates that, on the whole, such noncontributory social"
130,6,"assistance schemes lead to no or limited effects on the adult labor supply. With respect"
130,7,"to work participation (extensive margin) of working-age adults, the evidence indicates"
130,8,"that cash transfers have either no impact or limited positive impact, with cash recipients"
130,9,"more likely to be working. On number of hours worked (intensive margin), the evidence"
130,10,"is mixed, with examples of both increases in numbers of hours worked and decreases"
130,11,"as a result of cash transfer receipt. Where a reduction in work is observed, it is in rela-"
130,12,"tion to reductions in casual wage labor among those of working age, in paid work by"
130,13,"women with care responsibilities, and—in the case of social pensions provided to the"
130,14,"elderly—an associated reduction in the elderly working for pay (e.g., Baird, McKenzie,"
130,15,"and Özler 2018; Banerjee et al. 2015; Bastagli et al. 2016; Bosch and Manacorda 2012;"
130,16,"Owusu-Addo, Renzaho, and Smith 2018)."
130,17,"      Bastagli et al. (2016) review the evidence spanning 15 years (2000–15), from 165"
130,18,"low- and middle-income countries and find that cash transfers (noncontributory, targeted)"
130,19,"have either no effect or a positive effect on adult labor force participation. Out of eight"
130,20,"studies reporting on cash transfer impact on work participation for adults of working"
130,21,"age, four find statistically significant impacts, three being increases and one a decrease.4"
130,22,"In terms of the intensity of adult work, again, half the studies find the cash transfers"
130,23,"reviewed to have no significant effect. Among those that do, three studies find increases"
130,24,"and three find decreases. Among those with decreases, one was the result of a social pen-"
130,25,"sion in Brazil allowing elderly individuals to reduce time in paid work,5 another was only"
130,26,"significant among those who had not yet received a second transfer that was due,6 and"
130,27,"the third finds a reduction in hours worked in casual wage labor.7"
130,28,"      Similar findings emerge from other recent reviews. Banerjee et al. (2015) analyze"
130,29,"data from seven randomized controlled trials of government cash transfer programs (non-"
130,30,"contributory, targeted). Across the seven programs reviewed (based on results from 21"
130,31,"studies, covering 17 conditional or unconditional cash transfer programs that do not have"
130,32,"explicit work requirements for the poor in six countries), they find no systematic evidence"
130,33,"that cash transfer programs discourage work. Also, they find no observable impacts of"
130,34,"cash transfer programs on either the propensity to work or the overall number of hours"
130,35,"worked, for either men or women. Baird, McKenzie, and Özler (2018) find that, overall,"
130,36,"cash transfers that are made without an explicit employment focus (such as conditional"
130,37,"and unconditional cash transfers and remittances) tend to result in little to no change"
130,38,"in adult labor. The main exceptions are transfers to the elderly and some refugees, who"
130,39,"reduce work. In contrast, transfers made for job search assistance or business start-up"
130,40,"tend to increase adult labor supply and earnings, with the likely main channels being"
130,41,"the alleviation of liquidity and risk constraints. Owusu-Addo, Renzaho, and Smith (2018)"
130,42,"review 53 studies on conditional and unconditional cash transfers. Seven studies report"
130,43,"the impact of cash transfers on adult labor force participation, with only one of them"
130,44,"showing a significant effect. The Zambian Child Grant Programme resulted in a significant"
130,45,
131,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                                  107"
131,2,"decrease in adult labor force participation in wage labor outside the household (9 percent-"
131,3,"age points). This was primarily driven by a shift from agricultural wage labor to family"
131,4,"agricultural business. The effect was stronger for households with females within the"
131,5,"working-age group compared with households with males in this age group (Daidone,"
131,6,"Davis, Dewbre, and Covarrubias 2014). In their review of cash transfers in Latin America"
131,7,"and the Caribbean, Bosch and Manacorda (2012) find that noncontributory cash transfers"
131,8,"have no large significant effects on participation and overall employment (both the inten-"
131,9,"sive and extensive margins), other than possibly among the elderly."
131,10,"       The apparent absence of a significant large effect of means testing of cash trans-"
131,11,"fers, even when they generate a high marginal effective tax rate on paper (e.g., if based"
131,12,"on a clear income threshold and a unit increase in income by design leading to loss of"
131,13,"eligibility), is in many cases attributed to the implementation of targeting in practice not"
131,14,"leading to high marginal effective tax rates. Reliance on proxy means testing in many of the"
131,15,"Latin America and the Caribbean conditional cash transfers may also weaken this poten-"
131,16,"tial effect by weakening the link between program eligibility, earnings, and current income"
131,17,"levels. In many of the conditional cash transfers covered in the systematic reviews summa-"
131,18,"rized above, in practice participation in a program and the level of transfers are not affected"
131,19,"by people’s work decisions or household income level. For example, even though in theory,"
131,20,"according to program regulation, beneficiary eligibility status is reexamined at regular inter-"
131,21,"vals, such verifications may not happen in practice or may take place after several years."
131,22,"For example, in Mexico’s PROGRESA (Programa de Educación, Salud y Alimentación) pro-"
131,23,"gram, the eligibility status of households was supposed to be reviewed within three years"
131,24,"after a household’s entry into the program. In fact, more than five years elapsed before any"
131,25,"effort was made to revise the list of beneficiaries (Skoufias and Di Maro 2008)."
131,26,"       A recurrent theme in discussions of the reasons behind the observed labor supply"
131,27,"effects of cash transfers concerns the level/value of the cash transfer and the duration"
131,28,"of the transfer payment. Observed limited or lack of transfer effects on labor supply are"
131,29,"commonly explained in terms of the low value of the transfer (e.g., Bastagli et al. 2016)."
131,30,"Studies comparing work participation effects of transfers with different values find"
131,31,"mixed evidence: either no differential effects (e.g., Novella et al. 2012 find that despite"
131,32,"large differences in transfer sizes in Honduras’s Programa de Asignación Familiar, Mex-"
131,33,"ico’s PROGRESA, and Nicaragua’s Red de Protección Social any—limited—change in"
131,34,"labor supply is not correlated with the size of the transfer) or limited evidence that higher"
131,35,"transfer amounts are associated with a negative impact on the number of hours worked"
131,36,"(e.g., as outlined by the U.S. negative income tax experiment above; Burtless 1986)."
131,37,"       The duration of the transfer may also matter, as behavioral adjustments may begin"
131,38,"to take place only once a program is institutionalized and payments regularly made"
131,39,"in a predictable fashion over time. In the studies reviewed above, the experimental or"
131,40,"short-term nature of the transfers covered is commonly mentioned as another potential"
131,41,"reason for the limited or absent income effect of the cash transfer. Available evidence"
131,42,"suggests, however, that transfer duration and permanency need not be associated with"
131,43,"modified effects on work participation. A longitudinal study by Ardington, Case, and"
131,44,"Hosegood (2009) of South Africa’s old-age pension is a case in point, with a large (paying"
131,45,
132,1,"108                                                                      Francesca Bastagli"
132,2,"more than twice the median per capita income) and stable transfer resulting in increased"
132,3,"work participation among prime-aged adults in recipient households."
132,4,"Conditions of Paid Work"
132,5,"In addition to influencing participation in paid work, cash transfers may affect the con-"
132,6,"ditions of paid work and type of paid work carried out. The additional income accrued"
132,7,"through a cash transfer may help tackle the barriers to better work—for instance, through"
132,8,"productive investments. It may also support people in refusing insecure work and low pay,"
132,9,"and poor working conditions or employment relationships, and in demanding improved"
132,10,"terms of work. Such potential is especially strong with a UBI, some argue, by guaranteeing"
132,11,"everyone an unconditional income floor. A UBI could “prevent conditions of exploitable"
132,12,"dependency and vulnerability to abuse” (Birnbaum and De Wispelaere 2016), by provid-"
132,13,"ing them with an alternative source of income to paid work with no work conditionality"
132,14,"requirement. By offering an option to exit the labor force, a UBI would strengthen work-"
132,15,"ers’ negotiating power and voice (Calnitsky 2018; Widerquist et al. 2013)."
132,16,"      A different view argues that a basic income mostly facilitates the maintenance of"
132,17,"poor work conditions and low pay and acts as a subsidy to employers. According to this"
132,18,"perspective, a UBI would enable employers to reduce wages, since workers effectively"
132,19,"receive a top-up, and weaken the bargaining position of some workers. If a UBI increased"
132,20,"the supply of labor for low-paid and insecure work, this would be expected to have an"
132,21,"adverse impact on remuneration and terms of employment. The UBI would make it"
132,22,"easier for people to be hired into exploitative positions—casual or low-paid work—and"
132,23,"would in effect be a subsidy for such types of work (Gray 2017; Harrop and Tait 2017)."
132,24,"      Again, policy design is expected to make a difference. For example, the value of"
132,25,"the transfer and wider labor regulation are expected to influence whether a UBI offers an"
132,26,"exit option in practice. A basic income that is high enough to enable people to refuse low-"
132,27,"pay or insecure work may achieve just that; a basic income at a lower level could have"
132,28,"the opposite effect, making adverse work conditions including low pay more acceptable."
132,29,"Labor regulations on working time and guaranteeing a minimum wage could help ensure"
132,30,"basic pay and work conditions are not rolled back and address the risk that a UBI could"
132,31,"increase casual, insecure, and low-paid work (Gray 2017)."
132,32,"      What does the evidence show? A study of the impact on wages (wage rates offered"
132,33,"on advertised job vacancies and actual wages on new hires) of Manitoba’s three-year"
132,34,"Mincome guaranteed income scheme finds that the guaranteed income led to a consid-"
132,35,"erable increase in wages. Calnitsky (2018) finds the improved work outcomes were the"
132,36,"result of the guaranteed income providing workers with a threat of exit from the labor"
132,37,"market and, importantly, are contingent on a few crucial policy details: the absence of"
132,38,"conditionality in the form of work requirements and the fact that the scheme did not"
132,39,"replace existing welfare provisions and/or labor regulations."
132,40,"      Evaluations of the impact of targeted and unconditional cash transfers (to poor"
132,41,"households with children) on workers engaged in agricultural labor find that such"
132,42,
133,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                              109"
133,2,"schemes either have no impact on the type of work carried out or, when a significant"
133,3,"effect is observed, lead to a reduction in paid casual and occasional work and shifts in"
133,4,"the type of work considered to reflect improvements in work conditions and to be wel-"
133,5,"fare enhancing (Bastagli et al. 2016)."
133,6,"      In the case of Lesotho’s Child Grant Programme, an unconditional cash transfer"
133,7,"targeted to poor and vulnerable households with children, Daidone, Davis, Dewbre, and"
133,8,"Covarrubias (2014) find that the transfer reduces the intensity of adult participation in"
133,9,"paid occasional and irregular work—particularly piecework labor, which is generally con-"
133,10,"sidered a negative coping mechanism in times of hardship. In a later study, Dewbre et al."
133,11,"(2015) find additional resources provided by the Child Grant Programme and the Linking"
133,12,"Food Security to Social Protection Programme led to an increase in own-crop activities"
133,13,"for the labor unconstrained and a decrease in temporary wage work. A shift from occa-"
133,14,"sional agricultural wage labor to own-farm labor is considered welfare enhancing."
133,15,"      A study of the impact of Zambia’s Child Grant Programme on type of employment"
133,16,"finds a reduction in agricultural wage labor (Daidone et al. 2014). Agricultural wage labor"
133,17,"is generally considered the labor activity of last resort, and when liquidity constrained,"
133,18,"households may be obliged to overly depend on it. This is accompanied by evidence of"
133,19,"a small increase in permanent non-agricultural wage employment for females and an"
133,20,"increase in time spent working on family nonfarm enterprises as well as on own-farm"
133,21,"work."
133,22,"      For Pakistan’s Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Cheema et al. (2014)"
133,23,"find that the transfer is associated with a clear and significant reduction in casual labor"
133,24,"among working-age adults and an associated increase in the proportion of men engaged"
133,25,"in agricultural activities, including caring for livestock. Male members are redirecting"
133,26,"their labor toward two types of agriculture: sharecropping and own-agriculture, which"
133,27,"includes own-cultivation and livestock breeding, as the BISP enabled some households"
133,28,"to purchase small livestock."
133,29,"      In his study of the Madhya Pradesh and Tribal Village unconditional cash transfer"
133,30,"pilots in India, Standing (2013) finds that cash transfer receipt enabled changes in the"
133,31,"terms of labor market engagement. Access to transfers enabled recipients to move out of"
133,32,"the most exploitative forms of employment and into potentially more sustainable work,"
133,33,"and promoted movement out of casual wage labor (where households were sometimes"
133,34,"trapped in bonded labor or caught in interlocked markets for labor, land, and credit)"
133,35,"and into own-account activities. Skoufias and Di Maro (2008) find that conditional cash"
133,36,"transfers in Mexico enable beneficiaries, at least initially, to move from low-paid family"
133,37,"business jobs to salaried jobs."
133,38,"Valuation and Distribution of Unpaid Work"

134,2,"unpaid work and could in principle facilitate its redistribution, for instance, by allowing"
134,3,"individuals engaged in paid work to spend more time in unpaid work."
134,4,"      In the specific case of unpaid care work in contexts where care services are not"
134,5,"publicly provided, the additional income of a UBI could also be spent on paying for"
134,6,"such services, thus freeing up time for people engaged in unpaid domestic work to take"
134,7,"on paid work (Leibbrandt et al. 2013). As women are commonly the primary unpaid"
134,8,"domestic and care work providers (ILO 2018), this could have implications for women’s"
134,9,"participation in paid work."
134,10,"      A UBI’s distinguishing features—specifically its payment to individuals (as opposed"
134,11,"to households) and its unconditional nature—would be critical in this respect. Targeted"
134,12,"cash transfers that define eligibility based on household income are expected to generate"
134,13,"incentives for secondary earners in a dual-earning couple to reduce their participation"
134,14,"in paid work to help secure eligibility. With regard to conditionality, a UBI, by remain-"
134,15,"ing neutral regarding the activities in which individuals engage, could avoid potential"
134,16,"negative effects arising from imposing conditions either in terms of care work (and"
134,17,"potentially reinforcing the existing uneven distribution of unpaid work) or participation"
134,18,"in paid work (and associated penalties for differentiating between eligible and non-eligi-"
134,19,"ble in terms of labor market status)."
134,20,"      In the case of conditional cash transfers with behavioral requirements set in terms"
134,21,"of children’s regular school attendance and health care visits, adults’ time and task allo-"
134,22,"cation may be influenced both directly and indirectly. As is common practice in such"
134,23,"conditional cash transfers, when they are specifically paid to women in households with"
134,24,"children, schemes may reinforce women’s status as mothers and primary care provid-"
134,25,"ers (Cookson 2018; Molyneux 2009). By making mothers explicitly responsible for child"
134,26,"care, such conditional cash transfers can reinforce women’s caregiving role, reproducing"
134,27,"one of the underlying causes of economic gender inequality (ECLAC 2013), and working"
134,28,"against the redistribution of unpaid work."
134,29,"      Conditionalities of this sort can also affect time and task allocation indirectly, for"
134,30,"example, as children alter their time in paid and unpaid work as they increase school"
134,31,"attendance, leading to an increase in unpaid domestic workload for adults. On the"
134,32,"other hand, a reduction in remunerated child labor outside the household may lead to"
134,33,"increased adult participation in paid work to compensate for the associated income loss."
134,34,"Additionally, there may be indirect effects as child and adult health improves and caring"
134,35,"responsibilities for the sick or infirm are reduced (Barrientos and Villa 2015; Kabeer,"
134,36,"Piza, and Taylor 2012)."
134,37,"      On the gendered distribution of labor, feminist advocates for basic income highlight"
134,38,"its potential to correct the paid-work bias of contemporary social protection schemes"
134,39,"and increase women’s economic autonomy and power by providing a floor of economic"
134,40,"security for everyone and not specifying the activities in which they engage—thus help-"
134,41,"ing to recognize the unpaid work largely done by women without reinforcing existing"
134,42,"inequalities between men and women (McLean 2016). On the other hand, UBI critics"
134,43,"have argued that such schemes would do nothing to directly challenge gendered divi-"
134,44,"sions—and may well reinforce them, “especially to the extent that unconditional cash"

135,2,"transfers increase the incentive for women in particular to reduce their labor market par-"
135,3,"ticipation, given their relatively weaker attachment to the labor force as a group relative"
135,4,"to men, and the central role that this plays in broader inequalities such as income gaps"
135,5,"and poverty risks” (McKay 2001). Such arguments underscore the need for basic income"
135,6,"schemes to be accompanied by wider efforts to address inequalities in the gendered dis-"
135,7,"tribution of work in support of its potential for addressing these differences."
135,8,"      Empirical investigations into the effects of unconditional cash transfers on par-"
135,9,"ticipation in paid work provide some insights into the potential for cash transfers to"
135,10,"differentially affect men and women, reflecting variations in time use, distribution of"
135,11,"unpaid work, and labor market attachment."
135,12,"      Two studies of Germany’s Kindergeld (paid to all households with a child below"
135,13,"the age of 17) reveal the scheme is associated with a significant reduction in number"
135,14,"of hours worked (weekly working hours) among married mothers (Hener 2016; Tamm"
135,15,"2009) and no effect on fathers’ labor supply (Hener 2016). Among single mothers too,"
135,16,"Kindergeld is associated with a reduction in number of hours worked (smaller effect"
135,17,"compared with married mothers) (Tamm 2009). For both groups of women, the univer-"
135,18,"sal child grant does not have an effect on the extensive margin of work participation."
135,19,"Descriptive evidence provided by the authors suggests mothers are spending additional"
135,20,"hours on child care in the home."
135,21,"      Studies of labor supply responses of married women with children to means-tested"
135,22,"cash transfers explore whether and how these vary depending on their partners’ earn-"
135,23,"ings and time spent in paid work—reflecting issues of labor market attachment and"
135,24,"policy design, especially regarding means testing. In a study of the U.S. earned income"
135,25,"tax credit (EITC), Eissa and Hoynes (2004) find the scheme leads to a decline in labor"
135,26,"force participation by married women (by just over 1 percentage point), while the labor"
135,27,"market participation of married men increases (by about 0.2 percentage points). They"
135,28,"argue the EITC effectively subsidizes married mothers to stay at home, because the EITC"
135,29,"is based on family earnings as opposed to individual earnings. A study of the U.K. work-"
135,30,"ing families tax credit (Francesconi, Rainer, and van der Klaauw 2007) finds that, for"
135,31,"women with a partner who did not work or worked fewer than 16 hours per week, the"
135,32,"scheme increased the probability of working 16 or more hours per week by 3 percentage"
135,33,"points, while increasing the full-time employment rate by 2 percentage points. Based on"
135,34,"the disaggregated analysis by income and time spent in work by women’s partners, they"
135,35,"find no statistically significant response among women with wealthier partners. They"
135,36,"also find no labor supply response among men."
135,37,"      These results contrast somewhat with results on the impact of cash transfers on"
135,38,"single women with children. Both for the U.S. EITC and the U.K. working families tax"
135,39,"credit, studies find an increase in participation in paid work among single women with"
135,40,"children. Eissa and Liebman (1996) find that single women with children increase their"
135,41,"relative labor force participation by up to 2.8 percentage points (and observe no change in"
135,42,"number of working hours of single women with children and already in the labor force)."
135,43,"Francesconi, Rainer, and van der Klaauw (2007) find the working families tax credit"

136,3,"zation of child care (including because of the child care credit component of the working"
136,4,"families tax credit reform) in accompanying the increase in women’s employment. This"
136,5,"finding is echoed in a study by Eyal and Woolard (2011) of South Africa’s Child Support"
136,6,"Grant, which led to significantly higher labor force participation among mothers in their"
136,7,"20s—thanks, in part, to utilization of the transfer to pay for daycare/schooling."
136,8,"       Two studies of conditional cash transfers paid to women, with behavioral require-"
136,9,"ments on children’s regular school attendance and health care visits, and their effect on"
136,10,"the type of work carried out by women find that women spend more time on domestic"
136,11,"work as a result of the cash transfer.8 Rubio-Codina (2009) finds Mexico’s Oportunidades"
136,12,"increases women’s time spent on domestic work; she shows this arises from the reallo-"
136,13,"cation of time spent on unpaid housework between children and mothers as a result of"
136,14,"the cash transfer (as women increase their participation in these activities so as to substi-"
136,15,"tute for the work children were performing prior to the intervention). Ospina (2010) finds"
136,16,"that for Colombia’s Familias en Acción an increase in hours spent on domestic labor by"
136,17,"women as a result of the scheme was matched by a decrease in time spent on it by men,"
136,18,"who increased hours spent on paid work."
136,19,"       The role of conditionality in reinforcing a traditional patriarchal/maternal model of"
136,20,"care, strengthening women’s maternal responsibilities, and displaying little or no recog-"
136,21,"nition for women’s paid work has also been explored (Molyneux and Thomson 2011)."
136,22,"Even after a comparatively brief period of PROGRESA implementation in Mexico, Parker"
136,23,"and Skoufias (2000) find that mothers in PROGRESA increased their time allocation for"
136,24,"child care as a result of the time demands on women associated with satisfying program"
136,25,"obligations."
136,26,"       Studies of the impact of conditional cash transfers on child labor find mixed results"
136,27,"and examples of increases or low/no impact on girls’ involvement in unpaid housework."
136,28,"A study on Pakistan’s BISP (Cheema et al. 2014) finds a significant decrease in child labor"
136,29,"participation (including housework) for boys, but not for girls. The authors argue that this"
136,30,"is because girls are more engaged in household chores and because it is hard to shift"
136,31,"cultural norms, which are unlikely to be affected, at least in the short term, by cash trans-"
136,32,"fers. A 2015 study of Colombia’s Familias en Acción finds that the program increases the"
136,33,"leisure time of boys while reducing their paid work, but reduces the leisure time of girls"
136,34,"while increasing their domestic labor (Canavire-Bacarreza and Ospina 2015)."
136,35,"Formal and Informal Work"
136,36,"Theoretically, means-tested and conditional cash transfers could generate an incentive"
136,37,"for people to remain in or move to informal work as a result of eligibility rules that"
136,38,"imply formal work could disqualify them from receiving future transfers. It is also com-"
136,39,"monly expected that such incentives could be affected by the value and type of transfers"
136,40,"for which informal workers are eligible and how these compare with the conditions of"
136,41,"formal work (Banerjee et al. 2015; Bosch and Manacorda 2012; Levy 2008)."
136,42,
137,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                                  113"
137,2,"       In principle, as a universal and unconditional transfer, a UBI could weaken people’s"
137,3,"concerns that formal work could lead to loss of benefit eligibility. At the same time, by"
137,4,"potentially weakening links of social protection entitlements to formal employment, it"
137,5,"could create incentives for informality."
137,6,"       The available evidence for cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries indi-"
137,7,"cates that the targeting and conditionality elements of conditional cash transfers can"
137,8,"generate an informality incentive. For transfer schemes that explicitly target people in"
137,9,"informal work and exclude formal sector workers, the evidence highlights such examples."
137,10,"Bosch and Manacorda (2012) show noncontributory schemes in Mexico and Colombia,"
137,11,"accessible only to those who are not in formal employment, lead to a significant sub-"
137,12,"stitution effect induced by the eligibility criteria. A study of Argentina’s universal child"
137,13,"allowance, which explicitly targets informal workers with children, finds a large disin-"
137,14,"centive to labor market formalization for program beneficiaries (Garganta and Gasparini"
137,15,"2015).9"
137,16,"       In the case of noncontributory social assistance transfers that are not restricted to"
137,17,"workers in the informal economy, studies point to limited or no impact of a cash transfer"
137,18,"on informality. For Brazil’s Bolsa Família, paid to anyone with a declared income below"
137,19,"the income eligibility threshold, Holanda Barbosa and Corseuil (2013) find it had no effect"
137,20,"on the proportion of working hours households dedicated to informal activities. For Mexi-"
137,21,"co’s Oportunidades, Azuara and Marinescu (2011) find no effect on informal employment."
137,22,"       In practice, factors that influence a cash transfer’s impact on participation in formal"
137,23,"or informal work include policy implementation details; the supply of formal jobs; and"
137,24,"the conditions of formal work, including job security and social protection (e.g., see"
137,25,"Angel-Urdinola, Haimovich, and Robayo 2009; Garganta and Gasparini 2015). Much like"
137,26,"the case of income means testing, in the case of a scheme targeting informal workers"
137,27,"(or the unemployed), weak policy monitoring in practice may mean participants do not"
137,28,"fear losing the transfer by accepting a formal job. Moreover, the low supply of formal jobs"
137,29,"for typical cash transfer beneficiaries may be so low as to lead to insignificant program"
137,30,"effects. Finally, the advantages of formal over informal work—for instance, in terms of"
137,31,"job security and wages—may lead workers to accept offers in formal work even if this"
137,32,"implies discontinuation of benefit receipt (Garganta and Gasparini 2015)."
137,33,"Conclusions"
137,34,"Recent UBI debates and experiments have drawn attention to fundamental questions"
137,35,"about the nature and value of work and to the role and objectives of social and labor"
137,36,"market policy. The renewed interest in UBI has also (re)ignited important discussions on"
137,37,"the specifics of whether and how basic income schemes could address the limitations"
137,38,"and unintended effects of existing social protection policies and on the role of cash trans-"
137,39,"fer policy design and implementation details in shaping work outcomes."
137,40,"       This chapter contributes to the debate in two ways: first, by considering policy"
137,41,"implications for the type and quality of work carried out, in addition to common priority"
137,42,
138,1,"114                                                                        Francesca Bastagli"
138,2,"concerns for participation in paid work and financial work incentives; and second, by"
138,3,"paying close attention to the role of both cash transfer policy design details and the"
138,4,"wider policy context. A summary of the chapter’s key findings, including implications for"
138,5,"policy design and the wider UBI debate, follows."
138,6,"Work Incentives and Participation in Paid Work"
138,7,"The available evidence indicates there is limited or no impact of UBI-type schemes on"
138,8,"aggregate measures of participation in paid work. Breakdowns by population subgroup"
138,9,"indicate that effects vary, with examples of schemes leading to reduced participation in"
138,10,"paid work for some and increased participation for others. Reductions in “work effort”"
138,11,"are observed in some schemes among women in a couple with children and among the"
138,12,"elderly; and a reduction in participation in paid work among youth is associated with"
138,13,"the Islamic Republic of Iran’s universal cash transfer. In the majority of cases reviewed,"
138,14,"these results are discussed in terms of welfare-enhancing shifts as individuals take up"
138,15,"valued activities (by the individual or society) such as care and further education. The"
138,16,"specific case of care work and implications for gender inequality in the world of work is"
138,17,"discussed further below."
138,18,"      In terms of basic income/cash transfer policy design, the absence of a clear nega-"
138,19,"tive effect on work participation is in some cases discussed as the result of the low level"
138,20,"of the transfer. Another explanation is provided by the effect the cash transfer has on"
138,21,"tackling barriers to participation in paid work, such as costs associated with travel and"
138,22,"care of family members. The evaluations of Alaska’s UBI also point to the potential role"
138,23,"of a “macro” effect countering schemes’ income effect through consumption increases,"
138,24,"which stimulate labor demand and increase wages and employment."
138,25,"      Returning to cash transfer policy design issues, the evidence from means-tested"
138,26,"unconditional and conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries—"
138,27,"including ones generating a high marginal tax rate on paper (e.g., income-tested, with"
138,28,"clear eligibility cutoff and no benefit taper)—provides some insights into the relative"
138,29,"roles of the income and substitution effect of cash transfer components. The evidence"
138,30,"highlights the absence of a clear negative effect on work participation associated with"
138,31,"means tests in conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries. In the"
138,32,"case of income-tested transfers, this result is discussed as being linked to the weak imple-"
138,33,"mentation of the means test in practice, leading to a weak or no association between"
138,34,"changes in people’s incomes and transfer receipt in practice. This poses a challenge to"
138,35,"drawing conclusions with regard to the impact of means testing, including income tar-"
138,36,"geting, on work effort and to the potential advantages of a UBI over alternative targeted"
138,37,"cash transfers."
138,38,"      Attaching work requirements to transfer schemes is associated with higher partici-"
138,39,"pation in paid work in some schemes, but can work against the objectives of promoting"
138,40,"improved work conditions and quality. The absence of work conditionalities that require"
138,41,"workers to accept job offers appears critical to enabling basic income–type schemes to"
138,42,"contribute to improved wages and work conditions in the experience of some schemes."
138,43,
139,1,"Chapter 3. Universal Basic Income and Work                                              115"
139,2,"The inclusion of work requirements also raises questions about their potential role in"
139,3,"screening out vulnerable groups from participating in a transfer scheme. Conditionalities"
139,4,"set in terms of human capital accumulation, on the other hand, such as regular school"
139,5,"attendance and health care visits among children, have been linked to reduced partici-"
139,6,"pation in paid work among women, and may reinforce gendered divisions of labor. This"
139,7,"is discussed further below."
139,8,"Conditions of Work"
139,9,"The available evidence reviewed in this chapter shows that additional cash through basic"
139,10,"income–type and other cash transfers can lead to processes of emancipation by address-"
139,11,"ing constraints to better work and offering workers an exit strategy by strengthening"
139,12,"their bargaining positions."
139,13,"       How does a UBI influence these potential processes compared with alternative"
139,14,"cash transfer schemes? The theoretical debate is clear. Targeted and conditional trans-"
139,15,"fers with work requirements risk acting as a subsidy to low-pay and “bad” work. A UBI"
139,16,"would provide an exit strategy and options to workers if paid at an adequate level and"
139,17,"accompanied by adequate regulation, such as minimum wage legislation. One basic"
139,18,"income study indicates that indeed, continued support and regulation from wider social"
139,19,"protection and labor policy are critical for the scheme to contribute to higher wages by"
139,20,"increasing workers’ bargaining power. The experience of targeted unconditional and"
139,21,"conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries provides examples of"
139,22,"how regular additional income can lead to shifts in the type of work carried out that are"
139,23,"welfare enhancing. Examples include clear and significant reductions in casual labor"
139,24,"and decreases in temporary wage work as a result of cash transfer receipt. In all cases"
139,25,"reviewed, the schemes do not include work-related conditionalities."
139,26,"Valuation and Distribution of Unpaid Work"
139,27,"The theoretical literature points to the risk for additional unearned unconditional cash to"
139,28,"reinforce gendered divisions of labor, especially for some groups, such as among women"
139,29,"in a couple with weaker labor market attachment as secondary earners. The evidence"
139,30,"indicates that this can indeed be the case, with a number of basic income–type schemes"
139,31,"leading to reductions in work participation among women with children in a couple. At"
139,32,"the same time, the evidence for basic income–type schemes also highlights examples"
139,33,"of related increases in women’s participation in paid work when they enable women to"
139,34,"tackle barriers to employment participation, for instance, by affording child care."
139,35,"       In this regard, the potential advantage of a UBI over alternative schemes that are"
139,36,"paid to households or to specific individuals is that, by being paid to everyone individ-"
139,37,"ually, it avoids targeting the main breadwinner or the female “head of household.” This"
139,38,"feature, together with the unconditional nature of a UBI, promises to avoid the risks of"
139,39,"reinforcing the woman’s care-provider role brought on by cash transfers with human"
139,40,"capital accumulation conditionalities that target women, as highlighted by some studies"
139,41,"on conditional cash transfers."
139,42,
140,1,"116                                                                               Francesca Bastagli"
140,2,"       Both the theoretical and empirical literature appear to converge on the point that"
140,3,"for a basic income scheme to at a minimum not aggravate the unequal distribution of"
140,4,"unpaid work across the sexes, and to possibly address this inequality, transfers need to"
140,5,"be accompanied by wider efforts to tackle existing gendered norms and inequalities."
140,6,"Formal and Informal Work"
140,7,"Studies of the experience of cash transfers targeted to informal workers, and exclud-"
140,8,"ing formal workers, highlight how these can lead to disincentives to formalization. In"
140,9,"principle, the universal and unconditional nature of a UBI would reduce this effect. How-"
140,10,"ever, precisely these same features risk creating a disincentive to formalize by delinking"
140,11,"social protection eligibility from labor market status. The expansion of social assistance"
140,12,"schemes, aiming to reach both formal and informal workers, can weaken the incentive"
140,13,"to formalization."
140,14,"       Once again, a basic income’s positioning within the wider social and labor market"
140,15,"policy landscape seems to matter. If a UBI replaces formal worker contributory schemes"
140,16,"or is accompanied by a reduction in job security in formal employment, then there"
140,17,"may be a risk of weakening incentives to formalize. Its situation within a wider social"
140,18,"protection system that includes contributory and broader job security provisions holds"
140,19,"potential for reducing this risk."
140,20,"Notes"
140,21,"1.   The universal nature of such schemes poses a challenge to identifying individual-level effects"

140,23,"2.   Negative income tax schemes were tested in the United States in four separate experiments:"
140,24,"     New Jersey and Pennsylvania (1968–72); a rural experiment in Iowa and North Carolina"
140,25,"     (1969–73); Gary, Indiana (1971–74); and Seattle and Denver (1971–82). The Canadian gov-"
140,26,"     ernment initiated the Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment/Mincome in 1975 (Burtless"
140,27,"     1986; Widerquist 2005)."
140,28,"3.   Several commentators have voiced methodological concerns about the design of the U.S. neg-"
140,29,"     ative income tax studies. Only low-income families were included in the experiments. Many"
140,30,"     of the results are not attributable to the negative income tax per se but to the fact that the"
140,31,"     plans tested were more generous than the existing welfare programs for which the control"
140,32,"     group was eligible. This is likely to have overstated the work-effort response (Munnell 1986;"
140,33,"     Widerquist 2005)."
140,34,"4.   Among the two studies on elderly adults, one finds a significant effect from a social pension"
140,35,"     in Mexico of reducing pensioners working for pay. The second study, Dabalen, Kilic, and Wane"
140,36,"     (2008) on Albania’s Ndihma Ekonomike social assistance scheme targeted to households with"
140,37,"     an unemployed head of household, finds a negative labor supply response among female"
140,38,"     workers; the coefficient for males is not statistically significant."
140,39,"5.   Kassouf and de Oliveira (2012) find that Brazil’s Benefício de Prestação Continuada (BPC) social"
140,40,"     pension led to a reduction in hours worked, but by elders (over 65 years old), suggesting that"
140,41,"     the pension enabled elderly householders to retire and reduce the time spent in active work."

141,2,"6.  Bazzi, Sumarto, and Suryahadi (2012) only find a statistically significant reduction in hours"

141,5,"7.  Daidone, Davis, Dewbre, and Covarrubias (2014) find Lesotho’s Child Grant Programme to"
141,6,"    reduce hours worked in any labor by 2.8 hours in the previous week, with much of this due to"
141,7,"    a reduction in casual wage labor."
141,8,"8.  According to a 2016 review by Bastagli et al., three of six studies reporting on cash transfer"
141,9,"    impact on type of work (number of hours) by women find at least one statistically significant"
141,10,"    result. Two of these find an associated increase in domestic work. A third study finds a small"
141,11,"    reduction in the proportion of women engaged in unpaid family labor. Cheema et al. (2014),"
141,12,"    with regard to Pakistan’s BISP, observe that it has resulted in a (small) reduction in the propor-"
141,13,"    tion of women engaged in unpaid family labor."
141,14,"9.  Argentina’s universal child allowance provides a monthly benefit to households whose mem-"
141,15,"    bers are not registered in the national social security system, meaning that they are either"
141,16,"    unemployed or working in the informal sector."

147,5,"D"
147,6,"         ebates on universal basic income (UBI) are often polarizing. As other chapters"
147,7,"         examine in more detail, diversity in objectives, perspectives, and expectations"
147,8,"         can shape discussions in ways that make UBI somewhat elusive. Injecting"
147,9,"         more rigor and clarity in UBI debates is a priority. This chapter pursues two"
147,10,"core objectives to this end. First, we provide a practical application of the decision-mak-"
147,11,"ing parameters laid out in the overview of this volume. These parameters—coverage,"
147,12,"financing, delivery, etc.—could underpin virtually any social assistance program, but are"
147,13,"particularly compelling for a UBI given its large scale and deep implications. This chap-"
147,14,"ter provides more concrete examples and granularity around the trade-offs between,"
147,15,"for example, coverage, adequacy, costs, and financing options. Second, drawing on"
147,16,"existing data on social protection performance, we set out an illustrative typology of"
147,17,"country contexts. Microsimulations are run to provide further insights into the com-"
147,18,"parative impacts and distributional effects of a UBI replacing part of a country’s social"
147,19,"assistance portfolio."
147,20,"      By laying out and quantifying those trade-offs, the analysis aims to move the UBI"
147,21,"debate from one fueled by principles to a more evidence-based and contextual discus-"
147,22,"sion grounded in analytics. The chapter is not intended to provide ultimate evidence on"
147,23,"the effects of a UBI, as general equilibrium and dynamic simulations may better fulfill"
147,24,"that function. Instead, we use the simulations as a logical way to think about the issues—"
147,25,"as an analytical framework for approaching, unbundling, and understanding UBI within"
147,26,"a wider system of social protection."
147,27,"      The analysis complements an emerging literature that evaluates the cost and impli-"
147,28,"cations of UBI. Among others, Browne and Immervoll (2017) use EUROMOD data to"
147,29,"                                             123"

148,1,"124                   Jamele Rigolini, Nora Lustig, Ugo Gentilini, Emma Monsalve, and Siyu Quan"
148,2,"simulate the effects of existing means-tested cash transfers versus a UBI. Hoynes and"
148,3,"Rothstein (2019) review the distributional and behavioral effects of a UBI in the United"
148,4,"States. Based on household survey data from Indonesia and Peru, Hanna and Olken"
148,5,"(2018) use receiver operating characteristic curves and other methods to estimate trade-"
148,6,"offs between targeting errors (exclusion and inclusion) and transfer adequacy among"
148,7,"a UBI and flagship targeted programs. Based on Living Standards Measurement Study"
148,8,"data, Brown, Ravallion, and van de Walle (2016) predict the performance of various"
148,9,"proxy means–testing methods against a UBI in nine African countries. The International"
148,10,"Monetary Fund examines the distributional effects of a UBI in a handful of high- and"
148,11,"middle-income countries (IMF 2017), while Coady and Prady (2018) do so for India."
148,12,"Ortiz et al. (2018) and World Bank (2018) set out estimates for the cost of a UBI for a"
148,13,"large number of low- and middle-income countries."
148,14,"       We conduct a harmonized, comparable analysis for 10 countries ranging from"
148,15,"low-income Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal; lower-middle-income India and Indonesia;"
148,16,"upper-middle-income Brazil, Kazakhstan, and South Africa; to high-income Chile and"
148,17,"the Russian Federation.1 The objective is not to analyze the country-specific details of"
148,18,"a UBI reform, but rather to gain a better understanding of how the poverty and distri-"
148,19,"butional implications of UBI reforms may vary depending on country level of income,"
148,20,"the existing structure of the welfare state, and the taxation structure. While not assess-"
148,21,"ing them in detail, the chapter also points to some political economy challenges such"
148,22,"reforms may entail, including the identification of winners and losers who may oppose"
148,23,"the reform. The simulations estimate first-round effects and do not contemplate behav-"
148,24,"ioral responses (e.g., labor market responses that could stem from the UBI transfer or"
148,25,"changes in marginal taxation). More discussion of financing and political economy mat-"
148,26,"ters is presented in chapters 5 and 6, respectively."
148,27,"       The selected countries present substantially different outlooks and performance in"
148,28,"social protection systems. We group them in four broad clusters:"
148,29,"       1. Low coverage of the poorest deciles with progressive spending: Haiti, Kazakhstan"
148,30,"       2. Low coverage with flat or regressive spending: Mozambique, Nepal"
148,31,"       3. High coverage with strongly progressive spending: Brazil, Indonesia"
148,32,"       4. High coverage with slightly progressive, flat, or regressive spending: Chile, India,"
148,33,"          Russia, South Africa"
148,34,"To be sure, within each category there remain substantial differences; and for some"
148,35,"countries, the nature of coverage and spending may not allow for clear-cut categoriza-"
148,36,"tion. Overall, however, the classification will help to better identify challenges that relate"
148,37,"to specific features of the welfare state, or of the programs a UBI would replace."
148,38,"       The chapter unfolds as follows. The next two sections discuss the data and meth-"
148,39,"odology. The subsequent section presents the results, including the impacts of a UBI of"
148,40,"various levels of generosity on poverty, inequality, and distributional effects by age and"
148,41,
149,1,"Chapter 4. Comparative Effects of Universal Basic Income: Emerging Issues and Estimates  125"
149,2,"income deciles. For a subset of six countries for which there is information on the inci-"
149,3,"dence of taxes (Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa), we examine the"
149,4,"distributional implications of more generous UBI reforms that involve more spending,"
149,5,"which requires taking into account the higher burden of taxation.2 Conclusions are pre-"
149,6,"sented in the chapter’s final section."
149,7,"Data"
149,8,"The main sources of information for this chapter are the household surveys and admin-"
149,9,"istrative data housed in the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity"
149,10,"(ASPIRE); and, for the subset of countries for which such information is available, the"
149,11,"tax incidence results in the Commitment to Equity Data Center on Fiscal Redistribution,"
149,12,"which includes information on the incidence of taxes and transfers by decile from fiscal"
149,13,"incidence analyses that used a common methodological framework (Lustig 2018). The"
149,14,"household surveys include information on social assistance programs disaggregated"
149,15,"by program, welfare indicator (disposable income, expenditure, or consumption), and"
149,16,"household demographic characteristics. The ASPIRE database collects program-level"
149,17,"information on social protection programs including spending, number of beneficia-"
149,18,"ries, and program design features. Administrative data were available for 9 out of 10"
149,19,"countries (Haiti does not have administrative data in ASPIRE, and for Russia, we used"
149,20,"World Bank staff estimates; see table D.1 in appendix D). This database is used to val-"
149,21,"idate/compare amounts spent on social assistance programs from administrative data"
149,22,"by country, with the total benefit amounts retrieved from household surveys. The World"
149,23,"Development Indicators database is used for some of the indicators reported in this"
149,24,"study, such as the country income groups of countries, gross domestic product (GDP),"
149,25,"and purchasing power parity (PPP). Data on energy subsidies are from the International"
149,26,"Monetary Fund."
149,27,"       The choice of countries and years was driven by various criteria, the first of which"
149,28,"was quality of the data. Our preference was to include countries in which the household"
149,29,"survey captured the largest cash transfer programs. To avoid excessive discrepancies"
149,30,"between survey and administrative data, we selected countries and years for which the"
149,31,"administrative and household survey totals (both in terms of beneficiaries and amounts"
149,32,"spent) were similar.3 In the cases of India, Indonesia, and Mozambique, cash transfers"
149,33,"had to be imputed (see appendix D for details). To capture a large enough variance"
149,34,"in social protection approaches, we also aimed at achieving a balance between low-,"
149,35,"middle-, and high-income countries, as well as a regional balance."
149,36,"       Our simulations look at the poverty and distributional impacts of replacing selected"
149,37,"cash-based social assistance programs with a UBI. We looked to include countries with"
149,38,"distinct welfare systems regarding their cash transfer programs that would be replaced,"
149,39,"countries with poverty-targeted cash transfer programs with limited coverage and small"
149,40,"transfers, countries with relatively generous poverty-targeted cash transfer programs,"
149,41,"and countries with categorical coverage (box 4.1)."

150,4,"         In each country, the set of programs we consider is only a subset of all its"
150,5,"    social assistance/cash transfer programs (many of which are not well captured in"
150,6,"    household surveys); hence our description of the welfare systems may differ from"
150,7,"    a broader characterization that includes all programs. We here review countries’"
150,8,"    typologies as characterized by the years and programs we consider, and how they"
150,9,"    may differ from typologies that would consider larger sets of programs. A detailed"
150,10,"    list of programs considered in the analysis is provided in appendix D."
150,11,"    Haiti (2012), Mozambique (2014), and Nepal (2010). Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal"
150,12,"    have overall limited social assistance coverage; and the household surveys only"
150,13,"    capture a subset of this. In Haiti, the survey captures the scholarships program"
150,14,"    (less than 0.1 percent of GDP), and in Mozambique the Basic Social Subsidy (PSSB)"
150,15,"    program (of which around 0.1 percent of GDP is captured in the survey, against"
150,16,"    current spending of 0.6 percent of GDP in the social protection sector). Nepal has"
150,17,"    a large portfolio of social protection programs, which include public sector pen-"
150,18,"    sions, social security allowances, scholarships, health subsidies, and public works."
150,19,"    Most programs are categorical, and only around 0.9 percent of GDP is spent on"
150,20,"    social assistance programs specifically intended to assist the poor and vulnerable."

150,22,"    pension and child grants—around 0.4 percent of GDP."
150,23,"    India (2012). Over the past 15 years, there has been a major expansion and diver-"
150,24,"    sification of social protection programs in India. While the bedrock of social"
150,25,"    assistance, the Public Distribution System (PDS), has been in place since 1941, the"
150,26,"    Right to Food legislation of 2001 provided new impetus to social assistance provi-"
150,27,"    sions. For instance, half of the country’s children age 6–14 benefit from the national"
150,28,"    school meals program; 29 percent of rural households participate in the National"
150,29,"    Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), which provides 100 days of work at"
150,30,"    the minimum wage to anyone interested in applying; 52 percent of the population"
150,31,"    access PDS food subsidies; and between 19 and 22 percent of senior citizens above"
150,32,"    the age of 60 receive a form of social pension. The analysis is based on the PDS,"
150,33,"    since we do not consider public works in any country."
150,34,"    Indonesia (2014). Indonesia has made significant headway in introducing and"
150,35,"    enhancing social assistance. In 2012, for instance, general subsidies represented"
150,36,"    20 percent of the national budget. Since then, several rounds of reduction in energy"
150,37,"    subsidies have been achieved, with their share of the budget cut in half. Part of"
150,38,"    the savings has been reallocated to targeted social assistance programs, which"
150,39,"    reached 0.7 percent of GDP in 2018. A national registry of poor and vulnerable"

151,4,"  to adopt. The cash transfer program for poor and at-risk students has expanded to"
151,5,"  around 18 million students since 2012. Similarly, the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH,"
151,6,"  a conditional cash transfer program) has expanded from just under 2 million house-"
151,7,"  holds in 2012 to approximately 10 million in 2018. Overall, between 2014 (the year of"
151,8,"  our analysis) and 2018 the social assistance budget has increased by 50 percent"
151,9,"  in real terms (see appendix D). Targeted programs particularly benefited from the"
151,10,"  expansion—for instance, the PKH budget tripled in real terms between 2014 and"
151,11,"  2018. These developments will only have strengthened the findings from our analy-"
151,12,"  sis, which for 2014 classifies Indonesia as a high-coverage/high-incidence country."
151,13,"  Brazil (2015). Spending on social assistance accounted for 1.5 percent of GDP in"
151,14,"  2015. This is only a small share of the country’s total social protection spending,"
151,15,"  which accounted for 13.8 percent of GDP that same year, with social insurance"
151,16,"  pensions absorbing the bulk of spending (11.1 percent of GDP). Brazil’s overall alloca-"
151,17,"  tion to social assistance is in line with the global average for developing countries,"
151,18,"  but lower than regional (1.6 percent) and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and"
151,19,"  South Africa) (1.9 percent) averages. Two programs account for 75 percent of fed-"
151,20,"  eral spending on social assistance: the Benefício de Prestação Continuada (BPC)"
151,21,"  social pension and the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer. Although a wide"
151,22,"  array of social programs is financed from the federal budget, the BPC, which is"
151,23,"  targeted to poor elderly and disabled persons, is the largest program, absorbing"
151,24,"  0.69 percent of GDP (nearly half of all social assistance spending) in 2015. Brazil’s"
151,25,"  social safety net also includes numerous smaller programs that have become more"
151,26,"  diverse over time."
151,27,"  Kazakhstan (2015). The country has inherited a Soviet-style social assistance system"
151,28,"  and undertook several reforms over the transition period, gradually reducing"
151,29,"  in-kind untargeted subsidies and privileges and introducing means-tested trans-"
151,30,"  fers (including conditional cash transfers). The overall level of social assistance"
151,31,"  spending hovered around 1 percent of GDP, but means-tested programs remain"
151,32,"  small compared to disability and survivor allowances and compensation for the"
151,33,"  removed subsidies and in-kind categorical programs. The overall incidence of"
151,34,"  social assistance is progressive, since most of the categories receiving assistance"
151,35,"  tend to be in the bottom quintiles. About one-third of the population is covered,"
151,36,"  and coverage in the bottom quintile is over 50 percent. The survey captures only"
151,37,"  about half of the spending on social assistance due to underreporting of amounts"
151,38,"  received in categorical benefits, but captures the number of beneficiaries rela-"
151,39,"  tively well, as recorded in administrative data."
151,40,"                                                                                 (continued)"

152,3,"    South Africa (2014). South Africa has a very generous social assistance system."
152,4,"    According to ASPIRE, in 2015 the country spent around 3.3 percent of GDP on cash"
152,5,"    transfers alone. The poverty rate, according to the national poverty line, is around"
152,6,"    55 percent of the population, and cash transfer programs cover a large share of"
152,7,"    the poor population—91, 85, and 74 percent of the population in the three poorest"
152,8,"    quintiles live in households that receive benefits. Some benefits spread to the rich-"
152,9,"    est quintile, but coverage decreases significantly (22 percent of the population in"
152,10,"    the richest quintile live in households that receive benefits). The survey captures"
152,11,"    most beneficiaries (in fact, when weights are used, the survey registers slightly"
152,12,"    more beneficiaries than administrative data—see appendix D)."
152,13,"    Chile (2013). According to the ASPIRE database, in 2015 Chile spent around 3.5 per-"
152,14,"    cent of GDP on more than 150 social programs, ranging from social pensions to"
152,15,"    other cash transfers, housing, scholarships, school feeding, other in-kind transfers,"
152,16,"    social care, and employment programs, among others. The programs we consider"
152,17,"    are a subset of the cash transfer programs and include selected social pension, dis-"
152,18,"    ability, and family support programs. Overall, they represent 1.1 percent of GDP, of"
152,19,"    which 0.8 percent is captured in the survey (see appendix D). Because not all the"
152,20,"    programs we consider have a clear poverty focus, coverage is not highly progres-"
152,21,"    sive—45 percent of individuals in the seventh income decile still live in households"
152,22,"    that receive some of the benefits. Note that the largest poverty-targeted cash"
152,23,"    transfer program, Aporte Familiar Permanente (0.1 percent of GDP), started in 2014"
152,24,"    and is thus not included in the simulations, which are based on 2013 data."
152,25,"    Russia (2016). According to official statistics, Russia currently spends 3.2 percent of"
152,26,"    GDP on social assistance. However, some of the spending is statistical misclassifi-"
152,27,"    cation—for example, wage subsidies are counted as social assistance. Moving to"
152,28,"    internationally harmonized data, the overall level of spending is 2.8 percent of GDP,"
152,29,"    which comes close to the survey estimate of 2.4 percent of GDP in social assistance"
152,30,"    received. The amount budgeted for social assistance programs has increased in"
152,31,"    real terms over the last 10 years, but its impact on poverty remains weak. This is"
152,32,"    largely due to high fragmentation. A stocktaking exercise found 800 programs"
152,33,"    financed and legislated at the federal level, plus over 10,000 regional programs"
152,34,"    (there are 85 regions in Russia, so each has on average of over 120 different social"
152,35,"    assistance benefits). Only a handful of programs are poverty targeted, while most"
152,36,"    are targeted to specific groups or categories (e.g., veterans, artists, civil servants,"
152,37,"    sportsmen); and everyone within the same group is entitled to the same benefit,"
152,38,"    regardless of actual need. Hence, while 85 percent of the poor are covered by"
152,39,"    social assistance, they receive a disproportionately small share of it, with 80 per-"
152,40,"    cent of the budget going to the nonpoor."

153,18,"Methodology"
153,19,"Our analysis is based on simulations of the first-round effects on poverty and inequality"
153,20,"that result from changing the baseline social assistance system (baseline scenario) with"
153,21,"alternative UBI scenarios, both without and with financing in the cases for which the"
153,22,"UBI option implies higher levels of government spending. The cash transfer programs"
153,23,"included in the baseline cover noncontributory programs only: that is, means-tested"
153,24,"conditional and unconditional cash transfers, cash transfers based on categorical target-"
153,25,"ing (e.g., people with disabilities), and noncontributory pensions. Contributory pensions"
153,26,"and unemployment compensation programs are not included in the analysis because, by"
153,27,"definition, these programs have an insurance component and reforming them involves"
153,28,"complexities (e.g., financing for the transition period) that are beyond the scope of this"
153,29,"study.4 We also do not consider public works."
153,30,"      The UBI simulations proceed as follows. First, we select baseline cash transfer pro-"
153,31,"grams to be replaced by a UBI. Second, using the ASPIRE household survey database,"
153,32,"we subtract from each household’s income/expenditure the total amount for the selected"
153,33,"cash benefits household members currently receive under the programs chosen to be"
153,34,"replaced. Third, we simulate new values of disposable income (or consumption, depend-"
153,35,"ing on the survey) by adding cash benefits under a UBI scheme, and divide the new"
153,36,"disposable income totals for each household by the number of members to generate"
153,37,
154,1,"130                   Jamele Rigolini, Nora Lustig, Ugo Gentilini, Emma Monsalve, and Siyu Quan"
154,2,"values in per capita terms. The simulations only estimate first-round effects, and do not"
154,3,"contemplate behavioral responses or general equilibrium effects. Among others, we"
154,4,"assume away any behavioral responses concerning labor supply, an assumption that may"
154,5,"be appropriate to assess impacts in the short run, but may not hold in the longer run."
154,6,"       The typical characteristic of a UBI is that the size of the transfer is the same for"
154,7,"all beneficiaries. We consider accordingly a cash transfer that is given to each member"
154,8,"of the household irrespective of age. Our simulation decision may be in contrast with"
154,9,"several UBI policy proposals that recommend distributing smaller amounts to children."
154,10,"While this remains a common policy option, we do not want our comparison to be influ-"
154,11,"enced by demographics across countries; hence the choice of a flat, universal transfer."
154,12,"We have also generated results for a UBI that is given to adults only. We find that children"
154,13,"and poorer households (who tend to have more children) are negatively affected by such"
154,14,"a choice, but overall, the main policy findings would not be affected."
154,15,"       We consider four alternative UBI scenarios defined by increasing levels of gener-"
154,16,"osity. The main scenario is a budget-neutral UBI reform where the total cost of the UBI"
154,17,"program is equivalent to the cost of the programs it replaces.5 In most countries, the size"
154,18,"of the benefit going to the poor will be smaller than under the current programs. We"
154,19,"then consider scenarios of increasing generosity (see below for details); to balance the"
154,20,"budget, we need to either increase direct or indirect taxes, or reduce subsidies. Using the"
154,21,"incidence results from the Commitment to Equity Data Center for a subset of six coun-"
154,22,"tries for which such information is available, we simulate the net impact of combining"
154,23,"UBI transfers with various financing mechanisms. We consider three financing schemes:"
154,24,"(1) a proportional increase in direct taxes, (2) a proportional increase in indirect taxes,"
154,25,"and (3) a lump-sum increase in direct taxes for the richest decile. See appendix D for a"
154,26,"more detailed discussion of the methodology."
154,27,"       In our simulations, we also consider two poverty measures: the poverty headcount"
154,28,"and the squared poverty gap. There is a clear rationale in using two measures: the pov-"
154,29,"erty headcount is widely used in policy circles but fails to capture the impacts of poverty"
154,30,"reforms among the extremely poor. To give an example, assume that social assistance"
154,31,"covers the extremely poor well, but coverage is not as good among households whose"
154,32,"income or consumption lies close to the poverty line (this is the case, for instance, in South"
154,33,"Africa). A budget-neutral UBI reform may show greater poverty reduction when measured"
154,34,"with the poverty headcount index (because with the UBI all households close to the pov-"
154,35,"erty line would now receive a transfer—and hence jump over the poverty line); but the"
154,36,"reform would come at the expense of higher extreme poverty, because the budget would"
154,37,"be taken away from the extremely poor to be redistributed among a greater number of"
154,38,"people. The squared poverty gap measure, by giving a greater weight to the welfare of the"
154,39,"extremely poor, is more likely to capture such an increase in extreme poverty."
154,40,"       The choice of poverty lines also deserves some clarification. In our simulations, we"
154,41,"consider the World Bank income class international poverty lines; these vary by country"
154,42,"income levels, since in wealthier countries, higher international poverty lines are more"
154,43,"appropriate. As described by Jolliffe and Prydz (2016), each income class–specific pov-"
154,44,"erty line is chosen as the median of the national poverty lines of the countries in that"
154,45,
155,1,"Chapter 4. Comparative Effects of Universal Basic Income: Emerging Issues and Estimates  131"
155,2,"income class. Specifically, there are three income class–specific poverty lines: US$1.90"
155,3,"a day in 2011 PPP for low-income countries (Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal), US$3.20"
155,4,"a day in PPP for lower-middle-income countries (India and Indonesia), and US$5.50"
155,5,"a day for upper-middle-income countries (Brazil, Kazakhstan, and South Africa).6 The"
155,6,"World Bank has not generated poverty lines for high-income countries. Thus, for Chile"
155,7,"and Russia, we computed a poverty line based on the methodology proposed by Rav-"
155,8,"allion and Chen (2017). Using their formula, we compute the poverty line for Chile and"
155,9,"Russia as a function of inequality-adjusted mean and intercept for the lower boundary of"
155,10,"income (consumption per capita) in high-income countries. The result is a poverty line"
155,11,"of US$11.66/day in 2011 PPP. We set the poverty line for Chile and Russia at US$11/day,"
155,12,"which lies between our estimate and the US$10/day lower-bound national poverty line"
155,13,"reported for Estonia and Poland, two high-income countries (Ravallion and Chen 2017)."
155,14,"Note that these poverty lines are fairly recent, and may differ from poverty lines that"
155,15,"may have been used for poverty monitoring in many reports; therefore, some of the pov-"
155,16,"erty numbers may differ from existing reports."
155,17,"      The choice of programs a UBI would replace, and the way we interpret the results,"
155,18,"also deserves some explanation. First, the choice of programs is not dictated by the"
155,19,"belief that a UBI should replace specific programs, but by our intention to explore the"
155,20,"implications on poverty and inequality when certain programs are replaced. So, for"
155,21,"example, the choice of including social pensions in the programs a UBI would replace is"
155,22,"not dictated by a belief that a UBI should replace social pensions, but by our interest in"
155,23,"exploring what happens if a UBI replaces social pensions, which often represent a sig-"
155,24,"nificant proportion of the social assistance budget. Second, when we characterize social"
155,25,"assistance systems and refer to them as “poverty-targeted” or “categorical,” we do not"
155,26,"intend to make any claim about the social protection system of each country, but only"
155,27,"about the programs our analysis is taking into consideration. The simulations that follow"
155,28,"should not be viewed as actual estimates for the countries included in the chapter—any"
155,29,"country-specific proposal would require analyses that are better tailored to the specific"
155,30,"context. Rather, the objective is to reach a better understanding of how varying contexts"
155,31,"affect the impacts on poverty and inequality of varying UBI schemes."
155,32,"Results"
155,33,"The objectives of simulating the UBI scenarios (without and, whenever possible, with"
155,34,"financing) are twofold: first, to look at the poverty and inequality impacts of various UBI"
155,35,"scenarios according to their generosity; and second, to assess winners and losers from"
155,36,"UBI reforms. Accordingly, we begin by comparing the poverty and inequality impacts"
155,37,"of a budget-neutral UBI reform, where selected social assistance programs are replaced"
155,38,"by a UBI. We then look at winners and losers from the reform along the income ladder"
155,39,"and by demographic categories. Next, we look at the poverty and inequality impacts of"
155,40,"more generous UBI schemes, keeping the sources of financing as exogenous. The way"
155,41,"these more generous UBI schemes are financed, however, may significantly affect their"
155,42,
156,1,"132                           Jamele Rigolini, Nora Lustig, Ugo Gentilini, Emma Monsalve, and Siyu Quan"
156,2,"impacts on the poor. We conclude by looking at the poverty and inequality impacts of"
156,3,"these more generous UBI schemes when the financing side is taken into consideration."
156,4,"Poverty and Inequality in the Baseline Scenario"
156,5,"Figure 4.1 presents the baseline scenario poverty and inequality indicators, which include"
156,6,"the incidence of the cash transfer programs that existed in the year of the analysis. Note"
156,7,"that our estimated poverty impacts depend significantly on the choice of poverty line:"
156,8,"in countries where the poverty line represents a lower proportion of average income"
156,9,"(e.g., Kazakhstan, Russia), with all else being equal, the poverty impacts of a UBI reform"
156,10,"will be lower. Accordingly, in interpreting the results, excessive attention should not be"
156,11,"paid to the differences between the absolute impact on poverty of each scenario across"
156,12,"countries (which depends significantly on the choice of poverty line), but rather on the"
156,13,"differential impact of each scenario within each country (which depends much less on"
156,14,"the poverty line). In other words, the analysis does not focus on comparing differences"
156,15,"in impacts between, say, Russia and Brazil, but rather, on how a UBI reform would affect"
156,16,"poverty and inequality within each of these countries."

157,25,"  show the percentage point difference with respect to disposable income without transfers."
157,26,"  included. With the exception of Mozambique, the baseline allocation of social assistance"
157,27,"  programs is more effective in reducing the poverty headcount ratio than a budget-neutral"
157,28,"  UBI reform. The reason is simple. A budget-neutral UBI reform yields higher coverage at"
157,29,"  the expense of lower per capita benefits (since the same resources are now spread across"
157,30,"  all individuals). Because in most countries the poor are more likely to receive a transfer,"
157,31,"  the lower benefits effect dominates: that is, under a budget-neutral UBI reform, there are"
157,32,"  more poor individuals who fail to cross the poverty line because they receive lower ben-"
157,33,"  efits than individuals who now manage to cross the poverty line because previously they"
157,34,"  did not receive a transfer. In Mozambique, on the other hand, the higher coverage effect"
157,35,"  (more households are able to cross the poverty line) dominates the lower benefits effect,"
157,36,"  so a UBI delivers higher poverty impacts. In quite a few countries, differences between the"
157,37,"  baseline and UBI scenarios remain relatively small; we discuss this issue below."

158,2,"       Note that the impacts of both baseline programs and a budget-neutral UBI reform"
158,3,"are very low in low-income countries (sometimes close to imperceptible), as in Haiti and"
158,4,"Mozambique, because cash transfer programs remain extremely limited. Because of the"
158,5,"very limited presence of cash transfers, it will be difficult to assess the relative perfor-"
158,6,"mance of baseline programs versus a UBI reform, since it hinges on a very narrow group"
158,7,"of beneficiaries. The analysis in these countries will gain relevance when we explore the"
158,8,"impacts and costs of more generous UBI schemes."
158,9,"       While in some countries a budget-neutral UBI reform may deliver similar pov-"
158,10,"erty reduction impacts as baseline programs, in all countries but Russia the extremely"
158,11,"poor would be penalized. Figure 4.2b shows the same reform, now measured using the"
158,12,"squared poverty gap as opposed to the poverty headcount. The squared poverty gap puts"
158,13,"a much stronger emphasis on the welfare of the extremely poor, because—due to the"
158,14,"squared distance from the poverty line—the poorer a person is, the more that contributes"
158,15,"to the aggregate squared poverty gap. In all countries (apart from Russia), the baseline"
158,16,"system delivers larger impacts on extreme poverty reduction than the budget-neutral"
158,17,"UBI reform. The reason is simple: in all countries, extremely poor households are more"
158,18,"likely to receive some transfers, and a budget-neutral UBI reform would take away some"
158,19,"resources from the extremely poor to redistribute them to less-poor individuals."
158,20,"       Russia seems to be going the opposite way: when measured using the squared"
158,21,"poverty gap, the UBI scheme seems to deliver even better poverty impacts than when"
158,22,"measured using the poverty headcount—signaling that a UBI reform would likely make"
158,23,"many extremely poor better off. The reason, again, is quite straightforward. Russia is the"
158,24,"only country where the poor receive a substantially lower share of cash transfers than"
158,25,"the rich (see the targeting incidence in appendix D), which likely reflects the result of cat-"
158,26,"egorical targeting where poor individuals who are young and single or couples without"
158,27,"children are left out of the social assistance system. Thus, a budget-neutral UBI reform"
158,28,"would give many extremely poor households larger transfers.7"
158,29,"       These differences in relative performance across countries suggest that the pro-"
158,30,"gressivity of baseline programs matters. Figure 4.3 shows that there is a very strong"
158,31,"relationship between how much of existing resources go to the poorest decile, and"
158,32,"how much baseline programs deliver better poverty impacts (measured in terms of"
158,33,"the squared poverty gap). Referring to our categorization of welfare state modalities in"
158,34,"box 4.1, in countries where the existing welfare state is progressive, a budget-neutral UBI"
158,35,"reform would lead to significantly lower poverty impacts than the baseline system, while"
158,36,"differences remain smaller in countries with flat or regressive welfare states. In contrast,"
158,37,"level of coverage appears to have less of an influence on the relative performance of the"
158,38,"baseline system."
158,39,"       In Brazil and Indonesia, for instance, 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of the"
158,40,"cash transfers we consider are distributed to the poorest decile; coverage of cash transfer"
158,41,"programs decreases significantly along the income ladder (also see appendix D). Both"
158,42,"features indicate a fairly progressive social assistance system. Accordingly, the baseline"
158,43,"programs deliver a reduction in the squared poverty gap that is 116 percent (Brazil) and"
158,44,"86 percent (Indonesia) higher than a budget-neutral UBI reform. In Haiti, where over"

159,26," NOTE: Baseline programs are those we considered in each survey to be replaced by a UBI. The relative per-"
159,27," formance of baseline programs measures the additional decrease in squared poverty gap of the baseline"
159,28," programs with respect to a budget-neutral UBI reform, measured in percentage terms. A positive performance"
159,29," implies that the baseline programs deliver higher reductions in poverty."
159,30," 30 percent of the benefits go to the bottom 10 percent, the allocation of the baseline"
159,31," programs results in a reduction of the squared poverty gap that is about 170 percent"
159,32," higher than a budget-neutral UBI reform. At the other end of the spectrum, in Russia,"
159,33," the poorest decile receives less than 10 percent of the benefits, and coverage of social"
159,34," programs is high and fairly flat across deciles. In such a situation, a budget-neutral UBI"
159,35," reform would increase the poverty-reducing impact of social assistance, because more"
159,36," resources would go to the poor."
159,37," Inequality Impacts"
159,38," We conclude the section by looking at the impact on inequality (measured in Gini points)"
159,39," of baseline programs and the budget-neutral UBI reform (figure 4.4). In the low-income"
159,40," countries (Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal), both the baseline system and the budget-neu-"
159,41," tral UBI reform have limited effects on inequality due to the very limited resources (and"
159,42," coverage) of the baseline transfer programs. In the remaining seven countries, the bud-"
159,43," get-neutral UBI scenario results in lower reductions in inequality than the baseline. This"
159,44," is not surprising because the switch from the baseline to the budget-neutral UBI reform"
159,45," implies going from a system that is often progressive in absolute terms (e.g., the size"
159,46," of the transfer declines with income) to a system that is neutral in absolute terms (e.g.,"
159,47," the size of the transfer is the same for every member of the population irrespective of"
159,48," income). As shown by Enami, Lustig, and Aranda (2018), if spending as a proportion"
159,49," of prefiscal income is kept constant, a less progressive transfer will result in a smaller"
159,50," reduction in inequality."

160,19," Winners and Losers"
160,20," Any reform has winners and losers; and understanding winners and losers from UBI"
160,21," reforms is important not only from a political economy perspective (because losers could"
160,22," derail reforms), but also because having too many losers within the vulnerable popula-"
160,23," tion may defeat the very purpose of the reform."
160,24,"       Figure 4.5 presents the proportion of winners and losers (and the magnitude of the"
160,25," change in income or consumption) for five population categories: the overall population,"
160,26," children age 0–6, the elderly (age 65 and up), and people in the bottom and top welfare"
160,27," deciles. Several facts emerge. In low-income countries that have both low coverage and"
160,28," low levels of spending, a budget-neutral move toward a UBI would minimally affect the"
160,29," entire population. In Haiti and Mozambique, most of the population (including the poor),"
160,30," would find itself within 1 percent of previous income/consumption levels with a UBI"
160,31," reform. To be sure, previous beneficiaries may be hurt, but coverage is so low to begin"
160,32," with that gains from the reform would be too diluted to observe meaningful changes."
160,33,"       In countries with generous social pensions (such as South Africa), any reform"
160,34," toward a UBI would significantly hurt the elderly: more than two-thirds of the elderly"
160,35," population in South Africa would lose from a budget-neutral UBI reform that would"
160,36," replace social pensions. From a policy perspective, this implies that any UBI reform in"
160,37," countries with generous social pensions may need to consider topping up the UBI trans-"
160,38," fer with an additional transfer for the elderly. Given that social pensions often represent"
160,39," a significant share of social spending, such a constraint would, however, substantially"
160,40," increase the cost of a UBI reform."
160,41,"       Similarly, in countries where the baseline social assistance spending that we take"
160,42," into consideration is relatively progressive or covers a large part of the poor population"
160,43," (Brazil, Indonesia), many poor households would lose from a budget-neutral UBI reform."
160,44," In Brazil, more than 60 percent of the population in the poorest welfare decile would lose"

162,2,"from a UBI reform, and close to half the poor population would lose more than 10 percent"
162,3,"of their income with respect to the baseline system of transfers. In Indonesia, more than"
162,4,"one-third of the population in the poorest decile would lose more than 10 percent of their"
162,5,"income. In contrast, in South Africa (where more than 90 percent of individuals in the"
162,6,"poorest decile benefit from cash transfers), most people in the poorest decile would ben-"
162,7,"efit from a UBI reform. This is because people in the poorest decile tend to benefit from"
162,8,"child grants as opposed to social pensions, which are less generous; hence a UBI reform"
162,9,"that replaces social pensions would distribute larger amounts to many poor households."
162,10,"       If we look at the total poor population (not only the poorest decile) and exclude"
162,11,"low-income countries where budgets remain very small, our simulations indicate that a"
162,12,"significant number of the poor population would suffer losses from a UBI reform; the"
162,13,"proportion would range between 26 percent and 53 percent. The notable exception is"
162,14,"Russia, where only 16 percent of the poor population would suffer losses—again, the"
162,15,"result of a social assistance system based on categorical targeting rather than means-"
162,16,"tested transfers."
162,17,"       The simulations show that in most countries the richest decile would gain, albeit"
162,18,"relatively little, from a budget-neutral UBI reform. A few individuals from the richest"
162,19,"decile may lose from the reform—but only a very small percentage would lose more"
162,20,"than 10 percent of their income or consumption. Most of the distributional impacts from"
162,21,"a budget-neutral reform would therefore especially occur among the poor and, in some"
162,22,"countries, the middle deciles, but would only minimally affect the richer population."
162,23,"       Regarding the middle deciles, there is strong heterogeneity across countries."
162,24,"Figure 4.6 shows, for selected countries, the proportion of winners from a budget-neu-"
162,25,"tral UBI reform across income/consumption deciles (figure 4.6a), and how much people"
162,26,"would win/lose from a reform (figure 4.6b). In low-income Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal"
162,27,"almost everyone stands to win from a budget-neutral UBI reform, simply because there"

163,20,"          The simulations also show that in most countries the majority of children would"
163,21,"   benefit from a budget-neutral UBI reform. Again, these results need to be interpreted"
163,22,"   with some caveats. Existing child-focused social assistance often targets poor children;"
163,23,"   thus, the children who may benefit from the UBI reform may not be those who are in"
163,24,"   the greatest need of assistance. Figure 4.7 confirms that this would be the case in many"
163,25,"   countries (all middle- and high-income ones except Russia)—especially those where a UBI"
163,26,"   would replace large cash transfers covering (extremely) poor children, such as Brazil and"
163,27,"   South Africa. Figure 4.7 also shows that in all countries, distributing a budget-neutral UBI"
163,28,"   only to adults would affect child poverty even further—sometimes significantly, such as"
163,29,"   (again) in Brazil and South Africa. The main reason is the differential fertility rates across"
163,30,"   the income ladder. Poorer households tend to have more children per adult; thus, at the"
163,31,"   household level, the per capita transfer would be smaller if children did not receive it."
163,32,"          Overall, the findings show that a budget-neutral UBI reform has deep distributional"
163,33,"   impacts. Who wins and who loses from it depends very much on the type of programs"
163,34,"   the UBI is replacing, and on how well existing resources are geared toward the poorer"
163,35,"   population. In countries with generous social pensions, the elderly—and households"
163,36,"   with an elderly member—may lose significantly from a reform, but at the same time"
163,37,"   other population groups—such as children—may benefit from it. On the other hand,"
163,38,"   if a flat cash transfer replaces child grants and is only distributed to adults, poor chil-"
163,39,"   dren may lose from the reform. Furthermore, in countries where most of the resources"

164,28,"       In this section, besides the baseline scenario, we consider three scenarios with"

164,30," UBI scenarios. In the equivalent benefits scenario, the size of the UBI transfer equals"
164,31," the beneficiary-weighted average of baseline cash benefits among the existing pool of"
164,32," beneficiaries; in most cases, and unless every member of the relevant population is"
164,33," a beneficiary of all relevant programs, the size of the UBI and the total budget will be"
164,34," higher than under the budget-neutral case. In the poverty gap scenario, the size of the"
164,35," UBI equals the average distance from the poverty line among the poor; in all the con-"
164,36," templated cases, the poverty gap scenario delivers higher transfers than the equivalent"
164,37," benefits scenario, except in Kazakhstan.8 Our last, and most generous, scenario is the"

165,3,"not receive a high enough transfer to fully overcome poverty."
165,4,"      Figure 4.8 looks at the scenarios’ poverty impacts. There is a direct relation between"
165,5,"the generosity of the UBI transfer and its impacts on poverty and extreme poverty. The"
165,6,"relation is strongest in low-income countries (in our sample, Haiti, Mozambique, and"
165,7,"Nepal), where the baseline level of transfers makes only a minimal dent on poverty and"
165,8,"extreme poverty due to relatively low coverage. To observe a meaningful impact of a UBI"
165,9,"in these countries, the transfer should be at least the average level of transfers received"

166,3,"narios that deliver significantly higher poverty impacts are the poverty gap and poverty"
166,4,"line scenarios. But how much would these programs cost? Would countries be able to"
166,5,"afford such levels of spending?"
166,6,"      Before responding to these questions, note that the poverty line scenario yields a"
166,7,"relatively small improvement in poverty reduction for the extremely poor—as measured"
166,8,"by the squared poverty gap—than the poverty gap scenario. This is an important result"
166,9,"since, as we discuss below, the poverty line scenario is often too expensive and may not"
166,10,"be a viable option."
166,11,"Fiscal Cost"
166,12,"Figure 4.9 looks at the cost of the various scenarios, taking into consideration the cost"
166,13,"of the transfers but not the cost of program administration. It also compares the cost of"
166,14,"each scenario with baseline spending on social programs and with existing spending on"
166,15,"energy subsidies (from 2015 International Monetary Fund statistics)."
166,16,"      A first observation is that the cost of UBI rapidly increases with the generosity level."
166,17,"To distribute to the entire population the average levels of transfers currently received by"
166,18,"the beneficiary population (the equivalent benefits scenario), in low-income countries—"
166,19,"which tend to face limited coverage of social programs—the cost would increase from"
166,20,"0.4–0.7 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent (Nepal) and more than 4 percent (Haiti, Mozam-"
166,21,"bique) of GDP. But to make a meaningful dent on poverty, the generosity of the UBI would"
166,22,"need to be at least equal to the average distance of the poor from the poverty line—the"
166,23,"poverty gap scenario. The costs of such a transfer would be much higher, ranging from"
166,24,"7 percent (Nepal) to more than 20 percent of GDP (Mozambique). In middle- and high-in-"
166,25,"come countries, the poverty gap scenario’s cost remains lower, reaching a maximum of"
166,26,"8 percent of GDP in South Africa. This is because in middle- and high-income countries,"

167,9,"      Overall, even for scenarios that may not fully eradicate poverty such as the equiv-"
167,10,"alent benefits and poverty gap scenarios, the additional financing needs appear to be"
167,11,"relatively high. Nevertheless, to assess feasibility, what really matters is the additional"
167,12,"cost of a UBI reform, taking into consideration the fiscal resources that reform would"
167,13,"free up. In addition to substituting selected cash transfers, a prime candidate for replace-"
167,14,"ment would be subsidies—in particular, energy subsidies. These represent significant"
167,15,"amounts in many countries, and are often regressive in nature. Therefore, replacing"
167,16,"energy subsidies with a UBI may represent a politically feasible move toward more equi-"
167,17,"table redistribution, without sacrificing the universal nature of the subsidy."
167,18,"      In figure 4.9, we compare the cost of the various UBI scenarios with the cost of the"
167,19,"baseline programs they would replace, and the amount that countries currently spend"
167,20,"on energy subsidies. In most cases, replacing energy subsidies with a UBI may not lead"
167,21,"to meaningful impacts on poverty since subsidies remain below the financing needs of"
167,22,"generous UBI transfers. There seem to be a few exceptions, however. In Mozambique,"
167,23,"India, Indonesia, and Russia, replacing selected social assistance programs and subsidies"
167,24,"with a UBI would allow for financing the equivalent benefits scenario—which, in most"
167,25,"cases, would still deliver relatively low poverty impacts. Only in Russia would the combi-"
167,26,"nation of replacing existing programs and subsidies with a UBI allow financing of either"
167,27,"the equivalent benefits or poverty gap scenario."
167,28,"      In most countries, a UBI reform that would have a meaningful impact on poverty"
167,29,"would therefore need to be financed out of additional taxation. But under additional"
167,30,"taxation, the net impacts on poverty and inequality may change significantly, because"
167,31,"everyone would not only receive a flat transfer, but would also be taxed to finance the"
167,32,"UBI scheme.10 The net impacts on poverty and inequality of more generous UBI schemes"
167,33,"would depend therefore on the specific choice of taxation instruments, which we explore"
167,34,"below."
167,35,"Financing the Gap through Higher Taxation"
167,36,"Our results show that the costs of the poverty line scenario are too high to represent a"
167,37,"viable policy option. We thus focus here on the equivalent benefits and poverty gap sce-"
167,38,"narios and look at the distributional implications when they are financed through various"
167,39,"forms of taxation. As detailed in appendix D, the scenarios use consumable income (in"
167,40,"contrast to disposable income, as used in the previous sections) as the welfare indica-"
167,41,"tor and rely on the fiscal incidence results by decile available from the Commitment to"
167,42,"Equity Data Center.11"

168,2,"       Figure 4.10 presents the change in percentage points of the squared poverty gap"
168,3,"for the baseline system and the three UBI scenarios: budget neutral, equivalent bene-"
168,4,"fits, and poverty gap. The last two are not budget neutral, and we present the poverty"
168,5,"impacts for three financing scenarios: (1) a proportional increase in direct taxes, (2) a"
168,6,"proportional increase in indirect taxes, and (3) a lump-sum increase in direct taxes for"
168,7,"the richest decile. Cases that are left blank reflect scenarios that were not feasible to"
168,8,"compute or that would not be meaningful. For instance, in the case of India, covering"
168,9,"the financing gap of the poverty gap scenario with a lump-sum increase of direct taxes"
168,10,"of the top 10 percent would render the per capita disposable income of this decile below"
168,11,"that of the ninth decile. In Indonesia, the survey’s highest income is below the threshold"
168,12,"for direct taxes (Jellema, Wai-Poi, and Afkar 2017) so the scenario in which the financing"
168,13,"gap is covered by a proportional increase in direct taxes cannot be simulated. Note that"
168,14,"we show the poverty impact for the poverty gap scenario without financing not because"
168,15,"we think this is a viable option: if spending increases, someone will need to pay for it"
168,16,"either through higher taxes, borrowing (which could result in higher taxes on future gen-"
168,17,"erations), or grants from abroad. We show the without financing option for illustrative"
168,18,"purposes to demonstrate that, in general, the with financing scenarios feature poverty"
168,19,"impacts that are very similar to the without financing. It is also important to stress that"
168,20,"we are not advocating any specific financing scenario. The purpose of the analysis is to"
168,21,"illustrate how prototypical alternatives in the policy realm may affect UBI poverty results."
168,22,"       With this in mind, the results—perhaps unsurprisingly—show that, even after the"
168,23,"impact of higher taxes is taken into consideration, the poverty gap scenario results in"
168,24,"the largest impact on poverty. Furthermore, for either of the nonneutral UBI scenarios,"
168,25,"financing the budgetary gap with a proportional increase in indirect taxes is worse from"
168,26,"the poverty impact point of view than financing it with a proportional increase in direct"
168,27,"taxes. This is because in low- and middle-income countries, large parts of the population"
168,28,"do not pay direct taxes either by law or due to informality in labor markets; but most"
168,29,"are likely to pay some consumption taxes. Figure 4.10 shows that although the scenario"
168,30,"in which the financing gap is covered with a lump-sum increase of the top 10 percent’s"
168,31,"direct taxes will not affect the incomes of the poor by definition, the difference in pov-"
168,32,"erty impact between this scenario and the one financed by a proportional increase in"
168,33,"direct taxes is extremely small. Again, this is because the incidence of direct taxes for"
168,34,"the poor in most of the countries we cover is very small to begin with, and a proportional"
168,35,"increase of this incidence would not affect the income of the bottom deciles."
168,36,"       Given the above results, it may appear that an attractive policy option would be to"
168,37,"select a poverty gap UBI scheme and cover the financing gap with a proportional increase"
168,38,"in direct taxes. However, as shown in figure 4.11, in most cases the burden of direct taxes"
168,39,"on the top 10 percent would need to increase substantially under all taxation scenarios—"
168,40,"often by politically unrealistic proportions. In India, direct taxes on the top 10 percent"
168,41,"would need to rise from 2.2 percent to 68.4 percent; in Brazil, from 7.2 percent to"
168,42,"24.5 percent; in South Africa, from 19.9 percent to 40.3 percent; in Chile, from 5.4 per-"
168,43,"cent to 38.4 percent. The only case in which this option has more moderate impacts is"
168,44,"Russia, where the incidence would have to increase from 9.0 percent to 13.2 percent."

171,2,"      The impacts of the various financing scenarios on the middle deciles remain more"
171,3,"ambiguous, and depend very much on which/how much taxes the middle class currently"
171,4,"pays in each country. Simulations of changes in the taxation burden of various financ-"
171,5,"ing scenarios on the middle three deciles (deciles 4–6) show, however, that financing"
171,6,"a UBI with indirect taxes will put a much heavier burden on the middle classes than"
171,7,"financing it with direct taxes—which is again a reflection of the middle classes paying"
171,8,"taxes on consumption, while the incidence of direct taxes remains often small even on"
171,9,"the middle classes. Financing the poverty gap scenario with direct taxes would increase"
171,10,"the tax burden on the middle three deciles between 0.2 percent (Chile) to a maximum"
171,11,"of 3 percent (Brazil); in contrast, financing the poverty gap scenario with indirect taxes"
171,12,"would increase the tax burden on the middle three deciles from 3 percent (Russia) to as"
171,13,"much as 20.4 percent (India)."
171,14,"Conclusions"
171,15,"This chapter presents an overview of the issues and implications that a possible introduc-"
171,16,"tion of a UBI might entail. These include a variety of trade-offs across parameters such"
171,17,"as coverage, adequacy, and costs, as well as generating significant distributional effects."
171,18,"Emerging estimates from microsimulations are discussed within a broader framework"
171,19,"to help navigate and understand UBI relative to existing, cash-based social assistance"
171,20,"programs."
171,21,"      Several policy-relevant lessons emerge from the analysis. To begin with, we sim-"
171,22,"ulate the impacts of a budget-neutral UBI that replaces selected cash transfer/subsidy"
171,23,"programs in each country. We find that a UBI is less effective at reducing poverty than"
171,24,"existing programs. The difference in impacts is small in absolute terms, but in relative"
171,25,"terms is quite sizable. In fact, existing programs are on average about 60 percent more"
171,26,"effective in poverty reduction than a UBI. This is because most existing programs, even if"
171,27,"they may be only slightly progressive and miss some of the poor, tend to cover relatively"
171,28,"more of the extremely poor population. With a few exceptions, a budget-neutral UBI"
171,29,"reform would take resources away from poor households that are benefiting from exist-"
171,30,"ing programs, and give to richer households currently not benefiting. Importantly, these"
171,31,"findings do not account—or do so only indirectly—for other poverty-related aspects that"
171,32,"may affect performance and that are not easily observable from survey and administra-"
171,33,"tive data, such as transaction costs to access benefits, stigma, leakages, etc."
171,34,"      A second relevant finding is that a budget-neutral UBI reform leads to significant"
171,35,"distributional impacts. While, in some countries, differences in poverty impacts remain"
171,36,"modest, on average a UBI reform would generate more winners than losers among the"
171,37,"poorest segments of the population. However, the amount of gains by the winners is"
171,38,"lower (about half among the poorest decile) than the loss of the losers, raising a chal-"
171,39,"lenging dilemma for policy making. Who wins and who loses depends very much on"
171,40,"the programs a UBI would replace. Often, a large spending item is social pensions, and a"
171,41,"budget-neutral UBI reform that would replace social pensions would affect significantly"
171,42,
172,1,"148                    Jamele Rigolini, Nora Lustig, Ugo Gentilini, Emma Monsalve, and Siyu Quan"
172,2,"many elderly people. Similarly, if the UBI would replace programs that cover children,"
172,3,"or the UBI transfers were only given to adults, then children—in particular poor ones—"
172,4,"would be penalized by the reform. To avoid penalizing groups that are in need of social"
172,5,"assistance, it is critical to go beyond the analysis of poverty impacts and consider the"
172,6,"distributional implications in thinking through any reform. Such an analysis may also"
172,7,"provide an understanding of who may favor or oppose the reform."
172,8,"       The differences in poverty and distributional impacts from a budget-neutral UBI"
172,9,"reform that would replace social assistance programs appear to be relatively smaller"
172,10,"in countries where coverage of social programs is already quite high and transfers"
172,11,"are spread across the entire population. In countries where many social programs are"
172,12,"concentrated among the poor, a budget-neutral UBI reform would lead to significant dif-"
172,13,"ferences in poverty impacts and would see many people—especially poor ones—losing"
172,14,"from the reform. In other words, the less existing programs are poverty targeted, the more"
172,15,"a UBI reform may be a viable instrument."
172,16,"       To make a significant dent in poverty, however, in most countries the generosity"
172,17,"levels of a UBI transfer would need to be higher than a budget-neutral reform would"
172,18,"allow. We consider various scenarios, from distributing to each individual the average"
172,19,"transfer received by beneficiaries of baseline programs, to distributing an amount equal"
172,20,"to the poverty line—which is the minimal amount necessary for a UBI to fully eradicate"
172,21,"poverty. These more generous transfers have, of course, larger impacts on poverty and"
172,22,"inequality (although if the same amount of resources were distributed only among the"
172,23,"poor and vulnerable populations, poverty impacts would be even larger). Nevertheless,"
172,24,"they are also more expensive. Overall, we find that providing a UBI with a generosity"
172,25,"level that has a meaningful impact on poverty is financially prohibitive in low-income coun-"
172,26,"tries, but may be a relatively more viable option in some middle- and high-income countries."
172,27,"Giving every citizen a transfer equal to the average distance of the poor from the pov-"
172,28,"erty line would cost 7 and 20 percent of GDP in Nepal and Mozambique, respectively;"
172,29,"fully eradicating poverty with a UBI in the same countries would cost 36 and 48 percent"
172,30,"of GDP. In middle- and high-income countries, however, giving every citizen a transfer"
172,31,"equal to the average distance of the poor from the poverty line never surpasses 8 percent"
172,32,"of GDP; and eradicating poverty by distributing to every citizen the equivalent of the pov-"
172,33,"erty line would cost between 8 and 22 percent of GDP (although the amounts are highly"
172,34,"sensitive to the choice of poverty line)."
172,35,"       To assess whether these costs are fiscally sustainable, the sources of financing"
172,36,"must be examined. A potentially relevant source of financing may be subsidies—espe-"
172,37,"cially untargeted energy subsidies, which tend to be regressive in nature. We find that in"
172,38,"order to finance a UBI with meaningful impacts on poverty, replacing subsidies will not be"
172,39,"sufficient, and most countries will need to increase taxes. Only a handful of countries with"
172,40,"relatively large energy subsidies may be able to finance a UBI with meaningful poverty"
172,41,"impacts by replacing subsidies (e.g., Kazakhstan, Russia)."
172,42,"       Under additional taxation, the net impacts on poverty and inequality may change"
172,43,"significantly, because everyone would not only receive a flat transfer but would also be"
172,44,"taxed to finance the UBI scheme. We find that the poverty impacts taking into consideration"
172,45,
173,1,"Chapter 4. Comparative Effects of Universal Basic Income: Emerging Issues and Estimates       149"
173,2,"taxation are only slightly smaller than the gross poverty impacts that do not look at the financ-"
173,3,"ing side. While the findings may appear counterintuitive at first sight, they are consistent"
173,4,"with the fact that in many low- and middle-income countries, the richest deciles contrib-"
173,5,"ute the most toward taxation (in particular when informality is widespread), while taxation"
173,6,"minimally affects the income of the poor. We find that financing the budgetary gap with"
173,7,"a proportional increase in indirect taxes is slightly worse from the poverty impact point of"
173,8,"view than financing it with a proportional increase in direct taxes. This is, again, because"
173,9,"in low- and middle-income countries large parts of the population do not pay direct taxes."
173,10,"       The fact that generous UBI programs continue to have meaningful impacts on pov-"
173,11,"erty, even when considering taxation, suggests that they might be viable policy options."
173,12,"To assess their feasibility, however, it is necessary to look at the impacts they would"
173,13,"have on the richest segments of the population, which in most cases will have to con-"
173,14,"tribute most of the financing needs. Their impacts are not trivial, since on the one hand"
173,15,"the richer segments are taxed; but on the other hand, they receive a transfer as well."
173,16,"We find that in most cases, to finance UBI levels that have a meaningful impact on poverty,"
173,17,"the burden of taxation on the top 10 percent would need to increase substantially—often"
173,18,"by politically unrealistic proportions. In India, for instance, the direct taxes on the top"
173,19,"10 percent would need to rise from 2.2 percent to 68.4 percent; in Brazil, from 7.2 per-"
173,20,"cent to 24.5 percent; in South Africa, from 19.9 percent to 40.3 percent; and in Chile,"
173,21,"from 5.4 percent to 38.4 percent. The only case among our sample countries in which"
173,22,"this option seems within feasible realms is Russia, where the incidence would have to"
173,23,"increase from 9.0 percent to 13.2 percent."
173,24,"       To end where we began, we conclude by summarizing and locating the main find-"
173,25,"ings by country contexts:"
173,26,"       •• Where social assistance provides relatively adequate benefits, substantial cov-"
173,27,"          erage, and slight progressivity, policy makers could consider tackling specific"
173,28,"          bottlenecks that hamper eligibility, access, coverage, or delivery within the"
173,29,"          existing system. If a UBI is to be considered, it may have to be motivated by"
173,30,"          objectives other than a poverty-related one (e.g., automation-driven job insecu-"
173,31,"          rity, social dividends, etc.)."
173,32,"       •• Where coverage is high, but not progressive, a UBI could be considered an"
173,33,"          option, although some vulnerable (age) groups may suffer from the shift."
173,34,"       •• Where social assistance is limited, but provided progressively, a UBI would"
173,35,"          extend coverage but also flatten the distribution. If budget neutral, this means"
173,36,"          less for more, and likely less at the bottom."
173,37,"       •• Where social assistance is patchy and flat or regressive, a UBI could be an option"
173,38,"          to expand coverage if financed via progressive income taxation, elimination"
173,39,"          of energy subsidies, or redistribution of windfall revenues. Most low-income"
173,40,"          countries may not display those financing features; but some middle-income,"
173,41,"          resource-rich countries may."

174,26,"8.  Kazakhstan is the only country where the equivalent benefits scenario is more expensive"
174,27,"    than the poverty gap scenario because of a combination of relatively generous benefits with"
174,28,"    respect to a relatively low international poverty line."
174,29,"9.  To be sure, our simulations are highly sensitive to the choice of poverty line, which vary by"
174,30,"    country. If two countries have the same poverty line, but one is wealthier than the other,"
174,31,"    as a percentage of GDP, transfers will appear to be lower in the wealthier country. While"
174,32,"    using international poverty lines is the most appropriate option for a comparative study, more"
174,33,"    detailed country analyses should pay attention to country-specific characteristics in determin-"
174,34,"    ing the level of benefits. Accordingly, the impacts in Kazakhstan and Russia remain relatively"
174,35,"    modest because of the choice of using the international poverty line, which represents a rela-"
174,36,"    tively low proportion of each country’s average income."
174,37,"10. Replacing subsidies to finance a more generous UBI would also have differential effects across"
174,38,"    income deciles. However, given that subsidies may not be sufficient to finance a UBI with"
174,39,"    meaningful impacts on poverty, we focus the analysis on higher taxation alone."
174,40,"11. Consumable income is equal to disposable income minus indirect taxes plus indirect subsidies."

177,6,"        his chapter attempts to develop a general qualitative methodological framework"
177,7,"        to analyze financing options for a universal basic income (UBI), highlighting les-"
177,8,"        sons from the literature on how such options may be expected to affect public"
177,9,"        finances, income distribution, and poverty in different types of countries.1 Such a"
177,10,"framework could be used to guide analysis of a UBI and financing options in individual"
177,11,"countries that may be considering the introduction of such an instrument."
177,12,"       The chapter expands the range of financing options explored in the microsimulations"
177,13,"discussed in chapter 4. It focuses on options to finance a nonbudget-neutral UBI—that is,"
177,14,"one that would complement or replace existing social safety net mechanisms, but increase"
177,15,"the generosity of protection. This focus is justified by the fact that, as suggested by the"
177,16,"above-mentioned simulations, a budget-neutral UBI is likely to end up reducing the degree"
177,17,"of protection to the poor (especially the extremely poor) in most countries."
177,18,"       The chapter concentrates on emerging market and low-income countries, because"
177,19,"(1) informational and institutional constraints on targeting effectiveness are likely to be"
177,20,"more significant in such countries, and (2) existing studies on the effects of UBI introduc-"
177,21,"tion mainly focus on advanced economies.2"
177,22,"       In the next section, the chapter outlines a step-by-step framework for assessing the"
177,23,"fiscal space to accommodate the cost of a proposed UBI without raising additional reve-"
177,24,"nues or cutting other spending—that is, through a reduced surplus or through borrowing."
177,25,"This assessment would involve estimating both short-term financing possibilities and"
177,26,"their longer-term impact on debt sustainability, taking due account of risks. It would also"
177,27,"involve verifying the consistency of the new levels of the budget balance and the public"
177,28,"debt with any existing fiscal rules."

178,1,"154                                                                        Teresa Ter-Minassian"
178,2,"       It should be stressed that a decision to use available fiscal space to finance a UBI,"
178,3,"rather than other potential revenue or expenditure policies (e.g., cuts in especially dis-"
178,4,"tortive taxes or increases in education, health, or infrastructure spending), should be"
178,5,"made by governments on the basis of a careful analysis of the growth and distributional"
178,6,"implications of the alternative policies, and of their alignment with societal preferences."
178,7,"       If, as is often likely to be the case, there appears to be little or no fiscal space to"
178,8,"accommodate a proposed UBI with unchanged policies, countries would need to scale"
178,9,"back its generosity, and/or consider a range of expenditure-saving and/or revenue-raising"
178,10,"measures to finance it."
178,11,"       The chapter’s second section looks at the scope and impact of various types of"
178,12,"expenditure savings that could be pursued to fund, wholly or partly, the additional fiscal"
178,13,"cost of a UBI. It notes the usefulness of international benchmarking (using appropriate"
178,14,"comparators) in identifying allocative and technical inefficiencies in both broad spending"
178,15,"areas and specific expenditure programs. It also stresses the importance of sound bud-"
178,16,"getary institutions and processes in creating sustainable fiscal space for a UBI through"
178,17,"gains in spending efficiency. In particular, the chapter focuses on two areas of spending"
178,18,"where reforms could yield significant savings in some countries to fund a proposed UBI:"
178,19,"energy subsidies and the public wage bill."
178,20,"       The third section analyzes the likely effects of alternative options to finance a UBI"
178,21,"through revenue mobilization measures. It notes that the choice of revenue instruments"
178,22,"inevitably involves trade-offs between different objectives, including efficiency, redistri-"
178,23,"butional power, administrative and compliance ease, and political feasibility, since no"
178,24,"potential revenue instrument fares well in all these dimensions. While the trade-offs are"
178,25,"likely to vary by country, reflecting a range of economic and non-economic factors, some"
178,26,"instruments and policies score better than others in a number of dimensions. The chap-"
178,27,"ter discusses, on a tax-by-tax basis, the main considerations that should be taken into"
178,28,"account by policy makers in emerging market and low-income countries in assessing"
178,29,"these trade-offs. The final section summarizes the chapter’s main conclusions."
178,30,"Assessing the Fiscal Space for a UBI"
178,31,"It is, of course, possible to envisage a UBI calibrated ex ante to replace a set of existing"
178,32,"noncontributory social protection programs, at an unchanged fiscal cost for the budget."
178,33,"Under such a scenario, the analysis of first-round effects of the substitution would con-"
178,34,"centrate on the distribution of the new transfer among different groups of households"
178,35,"(different deciles of income, poor versus nonpoor, different age groups, urban versus"
178,36,"rural, etc.), compared with that of the replaced transfers. This analysis could be con-"
178,37,"ducted through microsimulations based on household surveys, such as those discussed"
178,38,"in chapter 4. To the extent that the household groups had different propensities to"
178,39,"consume or different income-leisure preferences, there would be second-round macro-"
178,40,"economic and fiscal implications, the assessment of which would require the use of"
178,41,"empirically calibrated dynamic general equilibrium models."
178,42,
179,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                    155"
179,2,"      In principle, it cannot be excluded that a budget-neutral replacement of targeted"
179,3,"social transfers with a UBI could turn out to be pro-poor under certain circumstances,"
179,4,"particularly when the targeting mainly reflects objectives other than poverty alleviation."
179,5,"However, this is unlikely to be the case in practice in most instances."
179,6,"      In fact, the microsimulations of this scenario presented in chapter 4 suggest that"
179,7,"existing systems of social protection in most of the countries analyzed tend to be more"
179,8,"cost-effective than a budget-neutral UBI in reducing poverty headcounts and the squared"
179,9,"poverty gap (which is a better indicator of impact on the extremely poor than the pov-"
179,10,"erty headcount). Moreover, in many instances, the welfare gains that would be obtained"
179,11,"by some groups of poor from the shift to a UBI are estimated to fall short of the losses"
179,12,"that would be experienced by other groups."
179,13,"      Therefore, in practice, policy makers considering the introduction of a UBI would"
179,14,"likely look to increase the generosity of the social protection system, with attendant"
179,15,"higher fiscal costs. The simulations in chapter 4 modeled the effects of three alternatives"
179,16,"for the level of the UBI: one equivalent to the average benefit provided to the recipients of"
179,17,"current targeted transfers, one equivalent to the average poverty gap, and one sufficient"
179,18,"to raise the entire population above the poverty line."
179,19,"      A policy to increase the generosity of current social assistance mechanisms requires"
179,20,"careful assessment of the existing fiscal space to accommodate the additional budgetary"
179,21,"cost without endangering financing access and debt sustainability and—in the event that"
179,22,"the space does not exist or is insufficient—of the options for creating (or expanding) it"
179,23,"through expenditure savings and/or the mobilization of additional revenues."
179,24,"      The assessment of fiscal space for a UBI costlier than existing social protection, on"
179,25,"unchanged revenue and other expenditure policies, essentially involves the following steps:"
179,26,"      •• Calculation of the additional fiscal cost, in terms of the primary and overall fiscal"
179,27,"          balances, and of gross borrowing requirements"
179,28,"      •• Analysis of possible sources of financing of the additional cost in the short to"
179,29,"          medium term"
179,30,"      •• Evaluation of the UBI’s impact on medium- to long-term debt sustainability"
179,31,"      •• Evaluation of the consistency of the resulting fiscal balances with any existing"
179,32,"          numerical rules"
179,33,"      The calculation of the first-round additional annual cost in terms of the primary"
179,34,"balance is relatively straightforward in the case of a fixed-amount UBI applicable to each"
179,35,"resident (or citizen) in the country.3 Its complexity increases if other eligibility require-"
179,36,"ments (such as age) are stipulated or if the amount varies across categories of recipients,"
179,37,"as such features involve additional (e.g., demographic) informational needs. Project-"
179,38,"ing the cost beyond the first year also requires making demographic projections and"
179,39,"assumptions about adjustments of the monetary amount of the UBI over time (e.g., to"
179,40,"keep its level constant in real terms)."
179,41,
180,1,"156                                                                          Teresa Ter-Minassian"
180,2,"       Estimating the impact on the overall balance is more complex, as this requires"
180,3,"assessing the effects of the change in the primary balance on the debt stock, and on"
180,4,"its cost over the short to medium term. In particular, this assessment should reflect the"
180,5,"structure of the debt (composition and maturity profile) and the likely elasticity of inter-"
180,6,"est rates to changes in the debt stock.4 These effects may initially be quite limited for"
180,7,"countries with strong policy credibility and relatively low debt levels, but may be signif-"
180,8,"icant for countries with prolonged histories of fiscal deficits, gross debt levels above the"
180,9,"average of comparable countries, and/or relatively low liquid government assets. They"
180,10,"would also be affected by the cyclical performance of the economy."
180,11,"       The impact of changes in the overall balance on a country’s gross borrowing"
180,12,"requirements would be stronger the shorter the average maturity of its debt. Careful"
180,13,"assessment of the prospects for mobilizing needed financing in the context of prevailing"
180,14,"market conditions would be essential, particularly if the additional cost of the UBI was"
180,15,"estimated to increase gross borrowing requirements to levels considered risky in light of"
180,16,"the country’s level of development and other relevant characteristics (e.g., its historical"
180,17,"record of financial stress).5 For low-income countries, this assessment should, of course,"
180,18,"take into account the scope for mobilizing additional concessional financing."
180,19,"       Assessment of the UBI’s financing prospects should be conducted over a multiyear"

181,25,"policy makers should look at scaling back the proposed amount of the benefit and/or"

181,28,"       Even if debt sustainability analysis does not identify significant risks, the fiscal"
181,29,"space for a UBI may be constrained by existing national or supranational numerical"
181,30,"fiscal rules—especially if the country belongs to a common currency area such as the"
181,31,"euro area. The number of countries that have adopted one or more such rules has grown"
181,32,"rapidly in recent decades (Schaechter et al. 2012)."
181,33,"       Fiscal rules vary widely in coverage (levels of government, inclusion of state-"
181,34,"owned enterprises, etc.), base (budget balances, public debt, and/or expenditures),"
181,35,"and features (flexibility, enforcement and revision mechanisms, etc.) as well as in their"
181,36,"effectiveness (Corbacho and Ter-Minassian 2013; Ter-Minassian 2010). Most “second"
181,37,"generation”–type rules strive to ensure a degree of flexibility—for example, through"
181,38,"cyclical adjustment or escape clause provisions. Nevertheless, for countries that have"
181,39,"deficit or debt levels close to the applicable rules’ limits, the cost of a nonbudget-neutral"
181,40,"UBI may turn out to be unaffordable without accompanying revenue increases or cuts"
181,41,"in other spending."
181,42,"       It should be stressed that, even if the debt sustainability analysis and the exist-"
181,43,"ing rules signal availability of fiscal space to accommodate a UBI involving additional"
181,44,"fiscal costs, the decision to use the space to finance the UBI, rather than other potential"
181,45,"revenue or expenditure policies (e.g., cuts in especially distortive taxes or increases in"
181,46,"education, health, or infrastructure spending) should be made by governments based on"

182,5,"This section discusses options to finance the cost of a UBI that cannot be accommo-"
182,6,"dated through the use of existing fiscal space wholly or partly through expenditure"
182,7,"savings. It is widely recognized that both the level and composition of public expen-"
182,8,"ditures vary across countries even more than those of revenues, reflecting a host of"
182,9,"economic, historical, sociopolitical, and institutional factors. Notable among such factors"
182,10,"are the country’s level of economic development, its demographic trends, political power"
182,11,"balances, and societal preferences regarding government’s allocative and redistributive"
182,12,"roles. These preferences are in turn influenced by citizen perceptions of the effectiveness"
182,13,"and efficiency of government spending. Institutional factors—such as the distribution of"
182,14,"spending responsibilities among different levels of government and the quality of budget"
182,15,"processes—also play an important role in shaping the level and composition of public"
182,16,"spending and the effectiveness of different spending programs."
182,17,"       Given the variety of country choices regarding the level and composition of public"
182,18,"expenditures, the scope for financing a UBI through savings in other spending is likely to"
182,19,"be highly country specific. This section looks at the main considerations that could guide"
182,20,"an assessment of such scope. After a brief review of some analytical tools that can be"
182,21,"used to assess the level and composition of pre-UBI spending and the cost-effectiveness"
182,22,"of its main categories, detailed information is provided on how to assess the scope for"
182,23,"savings in two important expenditure areas: subsidies and the public wage bill.6"
182,24,"       International benchmarking is a useful tool for initial identification of potential"
182,25,"candidates for expenditure savings in a particular country. A country’s performance can"
182,26,"be compared with that of appropriately selected other countries in three main dimen-"
182,27,"sions:7"
182,28,"       •• Levels of chief economic and functional categories of government expenditures"
182,29,"          relative to GDP"
182,30,"       •• Relevant indicators of outcomes in each area (standardized test scores and"
182,31,"          schooling completion rates for education spending, life expectancy and infant"
182,32,"          and maternal mortality rates for health spending, crime rates for spending on"
182,33,"          citizen security, etc.)"
182,34,"       •• Input mix for selected spending categories (public employment and public wage"
182,35,"          rates, teacher/pupil ratios and school equipment per pupil, hospital beds versus"
182,36,"          primary clinics, etc.)"
182,37,"The benchmarking tools can be more or less sophisticated, ranging from simple scatter"
182,38,"diagrams to data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier estimations."
182,39,
183,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                   159"
183,2,"       International benchmarking is extensively used in spending reviews, whether"
183,3,"comprehensive or sectoral.8 It helps assess whether weaknesses in public spending"
183,4,"performance are systemic, affecting most categories of spending, or specific to some"
183,5,"only. Systemic underperformances in a country are usually a symptom of serious insti-"
183,6,"tutional weaknesses—particularly in the budget process—such as a lack of planning or"
183,7,"medium-term budgeting capacities, unrealistic optimism in forecasting, poor control of"
183,8,"budget execution, and inadequate accounting and transparency practices. This last effect"
183,9,"is the availability and reliability of budgetary information, and consequently the politi-"
183,10,"cal accountability of budget policy makers. Careful diagnosis and public recognition of"
183,11,"such institutional weaknesses can help mobilize the broad social and political consensus"
183,12,"needed to carry out effective reforms in the relevant areas."
183,13,"       This benchmarking can also help identify concrete actions to improve the effective-"
183,14,"ness and efficiency of specific categories of spending, through both reallocation of funds"
183,15,"to better-performing programs, and changes in programs’ input mixes. Governments"
183,16,"can promote such changes by requesting spending units (ministries and other agencies)"
183,17,"to identify savings (the so-called efficiency dividends) equivalent to a given proportion"
183,18,"of their respective budgets, to be used for reallocation to priority or new spending initia-"
183,19,"tives—such as a UBI."
183,20,"       Of course, effectiveness and efficiency considerations should be complemented by"
183,21,"distributional ones. The impact of any proposed substantial reallocations of budgetary"
183,22,"spending on income distribution should be analyzed, particularly regarding level and depth"
183,23,"of poverty (poverty headcount and gap), using available household survey information."
183,24,"Subsidies Reform"
183,25,"Many countries at different levels of development devote substantial budgetary resources"
183,26,"to various types of subsidies. Consumer subsidies are more common, and costlier in"
183,27,"terms of budgetary resources, than subsidies to producers. However, producer subsidies"
183,28,"also can give rise to serious allocative distortions, with longer-term adverse effects on"
183,29,"productivity and growth. In countries with significant subsidies, policy makers should"
183,30,"carefully assess the scope for eliminating them—or at least for substantially cutting them"
183,31,"back—because such measures would yield gains in terms of efficiency and horizontal"
183,32,"equity, as well as budgetary savings."
183,33,"       The main types of consumer subsidies relate to food, energy, and water usage."
183,34,"The reform of food subsidies has many dimensions of a sociopolitical as well as fiscal"
183,35,"nature. While the trend worldwide has been toward replacing generalized price subsidies"
183,36,"for some essential foodstuffs with targeted in-kind interventions or with cash transfers,"
183,37,"reform paths have varied significantly across countries, reflecting demographic and"
183,38,"social characteristics as well as institutional capacities (Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov"
183,39,"2018). This section looks at energy and water subsidies, where the scope for significant"
183,40,"budgetary savings, as well as efficiency gains, is clearest."
183,41,"       Energy subsidies can be measured on a pre- or post-tax basis. A pretax subsidy is"
183,42,"defined as the gap between the supply cost of an energy product and the price paid for"
183,43,
184,1,"160                                                                        Teresa Ter-Minassian"
184,2,"it by consumers (households or enterprises). For products that are internationally traded"
184,3,"(such as fuels), the supply cost is taken to be their international price plus transportation"
184,4,"and distribution costs. For products that are not internationally traded (as is generally"
184,5,"the case for electricity), the supply cost includes generation, transmission, and distribu-"
184,6,"tion costs."
184,7,"         Post-tax subsidies include the pretax ones plus an adjustment for the revenue for-"
184,8,"gone by not subjecting the energy products to standard indirect taxes, and to corrective"
184,9,"taxes accounting for their adverse externalities (environmental and road damage, acci-"
184,10,"dents, and related health costs). The IMF estimates that total post-tax subsidies were"
184,11,"equivalent to 6.5 percent of global GDP in 2015 (Coady et al. 2015), with a very wide"
184,12,"variance across countries. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-"
184,13,"opment (OECD) study on energy taxes (discussed further in the next section) confirms"
184,14,"that only limited progress has been made in recent years in increasing corrective taxa-"
184,15,"tion on the uses of energy products in major advanced and emerging market economies."
184,16,"         Pretax subsidies (estimated by the IMF to be equivalent in total to 0.4 percent of"
184,17,"global GDP in 2015; Coady et al. 2015) vary significantly across countries, as well as over"
184,18,"time, reflecting changes in international oil prices and exchange rate developments."

185,2,"      Distributional effects vary across countries and products. Some energy products"
185,3,"(such as kerosene, liquid petroleum gas, fuels used in public transport, and electricity)"
185,4,"have a significant direct weight in the consumption basket of the poor. More generally,"
185,5,"increases in fuel prices may be passed onto the prices of other goods, such as basic"
185,6,"foodstuffs, that also weigh heavily in the consumption of lower-income groups. Empiri-"
185,7,"cal studies have shown that, in general, middle- to upper-income recipients receive the"
185,8,"bulk of energy subsidies.9 Frequently, this constitutes a major political obstacle to their"

185,15,"      •• Smoothing the impact of the initial price adjustments through an appropriate,"
185,16,"         preferably preannounced, phase-in"
185,17,"      •• Linking subsequent adjustments to developments in international prices (con-"
185,18,"         verted to local currency) through a formula"
185,19,"      •• Introducing simultaneous compensation mechanisms (e.g., cash transfers) for"
185,20,"         the most vulnerable groups of the population; the budgetary cost of such com-"
185,21,"         pensation should be taken into account in the calculations of the fiscal space"
185,22,"         created by subsidy reform"
185,23,"      •• Minimizing second-round inflationary impacts through an appropriate mone-"
185,24,"         tary stance"
185,25,"      •• Conducting an information campaign to sensitize the public to the benefits of"
185,26,"         the reform"
185,27,"      Introduction of a UBI may facilitate reform of energy subsidies, insofar as it would"
185,28,"allow a partial compensation of the nonpoor affected by the reform, who are likely to"
185,29,"be its most vocal and politically effective opponents. This option seems to be relevant in"
185,30,"only a limited number of countries, however."
185,31,"      The simulations in chapter 4 suggest that, in most cases, a UBI that could be funded"
185,32,"through the elimination of energy subsidies would not significantly reduce poverty. In"
185,33,"India, Indonesia, and Mozambique, replacing both subsidies and selected social assis-"
185,34,"tance programs would allow financing of an equivalent-benefit UBI—which would still"
185,35,"deliver only relatively low poverty impacts. Only in the Russian Federation would the"
185,36,"combination of replacing existing programs and subsidies with a UBI eliminate the pov-"
185,37,"erty gap."
185,38,"      Water subsidies can be defined as the gap between water supply cost, including"
185,39,"depreciation and maintenance of existing infrastructure, and the price charged to users"
185,40,"by water utilities. Frequently, these utilities are not adequately compensated for this"
185,41,
186,1,"162                                                                        Teresa Ter-Minassian"
186,2,"gap by the budgets of the national or relevant local governments—a fact that, as for"
186,3,"oil companies, leads to undercapitalization, poor maintenance of infrastructure, and"
186,4,"underinvestment, with adverse effects on the population’s access to good-quality water,"
186,5,"especially in rural areas. As a result, the true size of water subsidies is often significantly"
186,6,"underestimated in general government accounts."
186,7,"      Estimates by IMF (2015) point to an overall (on- and off-budget) cost of water sub-"
186,8,"sidies on the order of 0.6 percent of global GDP in 2012, but with large variation across"
186,9,"countries. Subsidies generally were found to be very limited in advanced economies, but"
186,10,"to range between 0.4 and 1.8 percent of GDP in other regions. Seven countries, some of"
186,11,"which are already under high water stress, were estimated to provide subsidies in excess"
186,12,"of 5 percent of GDP."
186,13,"      Water subsidies incentivize overconsumption of an increasingly scarce resource,"
186,14,"and therefore have substantial adverse implications for efficiency and sustainable growth."
186,15,"They are also inequitable, as they disproportionately benefit higher-income groups. The"
186,16,"above-mentioned IMF study estimates the share of these benefits going to the richest"
186,17,"income quintile to be nearly three times that going to the lowest quintile in a sample of"
186,18,"low-income countries. The gap was found to be smaller in emerging market economies,"
186,19,"but still sizable."
186,20,"      Phasing out water subsidies could provide significant savings, which could be used"
186,21,"in part to fund compensatory cash transfers to the poor. However, since water supply is"
186,22,"frequently a responsibility of local governments, the savings would largely accrue to their"
186,23,"budgets, rather than to the national one. This fact makes water subsidy reform a less"
186,24,"appropriate candidate to finance a UBI than reform of energy subsidies."
186,25,"Reforms of Public Wages and Employment"
186,26,"Wage bills worldwide absorb a large share of government budgets. In 2015 they repre-"
186,27,"sented on average an estimated 27 percent of public expenditures in emerging market"
186,28,"and low-income countries, and 24.5 percent in advanced ones—albeit with significant"
186,29,"variance around these means (IMF 2016). Intercountry differences reflect, in addition"
186,30,"to the level of development, structural factors such as societal preferences about public"
186,31,"versus private provision of public services and demographic characteristics such as the"
186,32,"shares of schoolchildren and older people in the population. Economic and electoral"
186,33,"cycles also affect the evolution of government wage bills, as do the institutional factors"
186,34,"discussed below."
186,35,"      Given their weight in government spending, government wage bills are obvious"
186,36,"candidates for scrutiny in any search for expenditure savings. This requires a coun-"
186,37,"try-specific analysis of the drivers of the evolution of their two determinants: public"
186,38,"employment and the average compensation of employees (wages and fringe benefits)."
186,39,"International benchmarking, in line with the caveats noted above, can help identify inef-"
186,40,"ficiencies and related options for policy reforms in this area."
186,41,"      The shares of government employment within the total working-age population"
186,42,"vary significantly across countries (figure 5.4). The average is substantially higher in"

188,16,"so over the medium term, on a more sustainable basis. They could also provide gains in"
188,17,"terms of efficiency and equity. Policy makers considering initiating or intensifying such"
188,18,"reforms should strive to obtain broad popular support for them by explaining their bene-"
188,19,"fits to the population at large. They should also ensure that the various strands of reform"

188,21,"distributional impact, and the extent and time profile of their expected budgetary payoffs"
188,22,"is essential in assessing their suitability as sources of financing for a proposed UBI."
188,23,"Assessing the Scope for Financing a UBI"
188,24,"through Revenue-Raising Measures"
188,25,"In contrast to the assessment of fiscal space on unchanged policies, which can be based"
188,26,"on a broadly accepted standardized framework, an assessment of the scope to finance a"
188,27,"UBI (or the additional cost of it) through revenue-raising measures involves a number of"
188,28,"country-specific judgments about the level and composition of tax and nontax revenues"
188,29,"before and after the proposed measures."
188,30,"       The vast literature on these subjects can help inform such judgments by shedding"
188,31,"light on the likely macroeconomic, allocative, and distributional effects of alternative"
188,32,"revenue mobilization options, as well as on their administrative feasibility. Ultimately,"
188,33,"however, a country’s policy makers have the responsibility for deciding on the trade-offs"
188,34,"such effects frequently imply—and their decisions are likely to be heavily influenced by"
188,35,"political economy considerations."

190,8,"       •• The degree of informality of its labor and other markets"

191,2,"suggested by theory and international experience, which, however, as discussed further"
191,3,"below, may not be necessarily applicable to individual countries’ circumstances."
191,4,"       It is clear from the table that no revenue source scores well in relation to all the"
191,5,"criteria; policy makers considering different revenue mobilization options face trade-offs"
191,6,"among them. These issues are discussed in more detail in the next subsections, with par-"
191,7,"ticular emphasis on considerations relevant to emerging market and low-income countries."
191,8,"Taxes on Personal Income"
191,9,"A policy maker considering options to finance a UBI would likely focus first and foremost"
191,10,"on the personal income tax (PIT), given that PITs typically have a progressive rate struc-"
191,11,"ture and therefore, in principle, high redistributive potential."
191,12,"       Indeed, the PIT is generally the backbone of the tax system in advanced economies."
191,13,"Revenues from the PIT average the equivalent of 8 percent of GDP in those countries, and"
191,14,"account for the largest share of tax revenues in these countries. The PIT also accounts for"
191,15,"most of the redistributive impact of tax systems in OECD countries,11 despite the fact that"
191,16,"(1) the progressivity of the rate structure has been significantly reduced in recent decades,"
191,17,"(2) many countries have moved toward a dual PIT system through more favorable treat-"
191,18,"ment of capital income and capital gains, and (3) they maintain a number of deductions"
191,19,"that predominantly benefit the higher deciles of the income distribution."
191,20,"       In contrast, in emerging market and low-income countries, both the redistribu-"
191,21,"tive and the revenue-raising capacities of the PIT tend to be seriously undermined by a"
191,22,"number of factors:"
191,23,"       •• High threshold levels (sometimes multiples of median per capita income), which"
191,24,"           concentrate the tax burden on a relatively small proportion of the population"
191,25,"       •• Frequent exemption of capital income and capital gains"
191,26,"       •• A proliferation of deductions and special treatments (tax expenditures)"
191,27,"       •• A high degree of labor market informality"
191,28,"       •• Lower capacities of the tax administration, which enables tax avoidance and"
191,29,"           outright evasion"
191,30,"       Some of these factors interact, compounding the respective adverse effects. For"
191,31,"instance, checking eligibility for deductions and exemptions absorbs resources of already"
191,32,"weak tax administrations, reducing their enforcement capacities. Some deductions and"
191,33,"special treatments also have efficiency costs, promoting excessive resort to debt or"
191,34,"distorting the allocation of savings. A high degree of informality erodes the tax base,"
191,35,"requiring higher rates, which in turn further incentivize informality, with an adverse"
191,36,"impact on firm size and productivity."
191,37,"       The impact of these factors on PIT revenues is evidenced by figure 5.8, which shows"
191,38,"that the average PIT/GDP ratio in emerging market economies is less than one-third (and that"

192,22,"increases in the PIT in a particular country needs to start from a diagnostic of the main"
192,23,"specific obstacles to the revenue-raising capacity of the tax in that country. This can"
192,24,"provide initial guidance in identifying feasible policy options to raise the needed addi-"
192,25,"tional revenue from the tax. In general, steps to broaden the tax base are preferable to"
192,26,"increases in rates, because they are more efficiency-friendly,12 improve horizontal equity,"
192,27,"and facilitate the administration of the tax; but changes in tax schedules may also be"
192,28,"appropriate in some circumstances, as detailed below."
192,29,"       A comparison of the income threshold for the PIT with the median per capita"
192,30,"income can provide insights into the scope for reducing the threshold. An analysis of tax"
192,31,"expenditures under the PIT can point to likely candidates for elimination or for scaling"
192,32,"back.13 In line with the IMF Manual on Fiscal Transparency’s recommendation to compile"
192,33,"estimates of tax expenditures and include them in budget documentation (IMF 2007),"
192,34,"many countries do publish such estimates.14"
192,35,"       Assessment of the potential revenue gains from repealing some deductions should"
192,36,"ideally be accompanied by an analysis of the distributional effects of such a move. How-"
192,37,"ever, in many countries, this may be constrained by a lack of sufficiently detailed data on"
192,38,"the income distribution of the beneficiaries of tax expenditures. An alternative approach"
192,39,"could be to impose a cap on the total amount of deductions a taxpayer can claim, spec-"
192,40,"ified as a declining percentage of his or her pretax income. The introduction of such a"
192,41,"cap would by design enhance the progressivity of the PIT, compared to the preexisting"
192,42,"system."
192,43,"       The scope for broadening the tax base to some harder-to-assess incomes such"
192,44,"as fringe benefits, homeowners’ imputed rents, and income from self-employment"
192,45,"depends on the state of the tax administration in a given country. Presumptive assess-"
192,46,"ment methods can be resorted to, but inevitably entail costs in terms of horizontal"
192,47,"equity, as taxpayers with different levels of actual income may be subject to the same"
192,48,"tax burden. Also, setting up such systems may involve significant administrative costs"
192,49,"and delays."

193,2,"      The taxation of personal incomes from capital highlights the trade-offs between"
193,3,"the objectives of revenue mobilization, redistribution, and economic efficiency. There"
193,4,"are several efficiency considerations that argue for a lower tax burden on capital income"
193,5,"than on labor income:"
193,6,"      •• The greater cross-border mobility of capital than labor, which enhances the"
193,7,"         scope for tax competition among countries seeking to attract foreign capital,"
193,8,"         although the attractiveness of tax havens is likely to have been reduced by the"
193,9,"         OECD-sponsored recent advances in automatic exchange of information among"
193,10,"         tax administrations"
193,11,"      •• The fact that entrepreneurial income is taxed under the corporate income tax"
193,12,"         (CIT), and then again under the PIT when distributed as dividends, except in the"
193,13,"         (not common) case of full integration of the two taxes"
193,14,"      •• The fact that taxing the inflation-related component of capital income is tanta-"
193,15,"         mount to taxing the capital stock itself; thus, a lower rate of capital taxation is an"
193,16,"         approximation to taxing only the real return on capital"
193,17,"      •• A relatively low tax burden on capital income is also sometimes justified by"
193,18,"         the objective of promoting domestic savings, although the available empiri-"
193,19,"         cal evidence on the weight of tax considerations in savings decisions remains"
193,20,"         inconclusive"
193,21,"      At the same time, distributional considerations argue against discriminating in"
193,22,"favor of capital incomes, since the share of capital in total incomes of taxpayers tends to"
193,23,"rise with the level of income. Different countries weigh the two types of considerations"
193,24,"differently, but the growing worldwide trend toward dual PITs suggests that the bal-"
193,25,"ance is tilted in favor of the efficiency arguments. Nevertheless, countries that currently"
193,26,"exempt certain types of capital incomes, or tax them at very low rates, may have scope"
193,27,"for mobilizing additional revenue through the introduction of a comprehensive dual PIT,"
193,28,"with the same rate for all types of capital income, or through a moderate increase in its"
193,29,"rate. Similar considerations apply to the taxation of capital gains.15"
193,30,"      In summary, there are a number of steps that can be taken in emerging market"
193,31,"and low-income countries to improve the revenue performance (and simultaneously the"
193,32,"redistributive power) of the PIT, but in most cases they should realistically be expected"
193,33,"to cover only a fraction of the cost of a UBI, if the latter is projected to exceed 1–2 per-"
193,34,"cent of GDP."
193,35,"      The illustrative microsimulations presented in chapter 4 focus on increases in PIT"
193,36,"rates (an across-the-board surcharge and an increase concentrated on the upper decile)"
193,37,"for simplicity and cross-country comparability, but country-specific analyses should pref-"
193,38,"erably include modeling options to broaden the PIT base. Those simulations suggest"
193,39,"that, since in most emerging market and developing countries the lower-income deciles"
193,40,"are not taxable under current PIT rate schedules, funding a UBI with increases in the"
193,41,
194,1,"170                                                                        Teresa Ter-Minassian"
194,2,"latter would be quite effective in reducing poverty. However, financing a UBI sufficient"
194,3,"to eliminate the poverty gap would require increases in the PIT’s burden on the upper"
194,4,"deciles too large to be politically feasible in all the countries in the simulation sample,"
194,5,"with the possible exception of Russia."
194,6,"Taxes on Corporate Income"
194,7,"A second potential revenue source for the UBI is the corporate income tax. Differences"
194,8,"in the revenue performance of the CIT across groups of countries are smaller than those"
194,9,"in the PIT (figure 5.9). This is the case because many emerging market and low-in-"
194,10,"come countries are natural resource revenue producers that can extract significant"
194,11,"rents (in the form of profit taxes as well as royalties) from the (predominantly foreign)"

194,32,"as a result of a proliferation of tax incentives, and of tax planning practices such as thin"
194,33,"capitalization and international transfer pricing. While recent initiatives promoted by"

194,36,"enues over the medium term, international competition is likely to continue putting"
194,37,"downward pressure on CIT rates worldwide for the foreseeable future."
194,38,"       In summary, although policy makers should be encouraged to intensify efforts to"
194,39,"broaden the CIT base, including by closely scrutinizing the benefits of any incentives"
194,40,"under the tax and by implementing the anti-avoidance and evasion measures rec-"
194,41,"ommended by international institutions, it would not seem realistic over the short to"
194,42,"medium term to rely on increases in the CIT to fund a UBI."
194,43,"Taxes on Wealth"
194,44,"It is a well-known fact that wealth is even more unequally distributed than incomes."
194,45,"For instance, in the OECD, the bottom 40 percent is estimated to own only 3 percent"
194,46,
195,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                  171"
195,2,"of household wealth (in contrast to 20 percent of income), while the top decile owns"
195,3,"50 percent of such wealth (25 percent of income). While comparable data are lacking"
195,4,"for non-OECD countries, wealth inequality is unlikely to be smaller on average in those"
195,5,"countries. Moreover, there is clear evidence that wealth inequality has been rising in"
195,6,"many countries in recent decades."
195,7,"      There is thus a strong case for taxing wealth on distributional grounds, and for"
195,8,"policy makers seeking revenue sources to fund a UBI to explore options in this area."
195,9,"The case is reinforced by the fact that some taxes on wealth, notably recurrent taxes on"
195,10,"immovable properties, have low efficiency costs and are therefore considered relatively"
195,11,"growth-friendly (Eyraud 2015; OECD 2010)."
195,12,"      However, despite these advantages, taxes on property account for relatively low"
195,13,"shares of total tax revenues (less than 6 percent in advanced economies, and less than"
195,14,"3 percent in emerging ones). Taxes on a more comprehensive measure of wealth (per-"
195,15,"sonal net worth) are even less common and productive in terms of revenue. Only six"
195,16,"OECD countries and very few non-OECD ones (four in Latin America) levy such taxes,"
195,17,"and only Switzerland obtains significant revenues from them (Benitez and Velayos 2018)."
195,18,"      The poor revenue performance of property taxes can be explained by a number"
195,19,"of factors."
195,20,"      •• Difficulty of administration. A well-functioning property tax requires setting up"
195,21,"         and regularly updating property cadasters, a task that is resource intensive,"
195,22,"         albeit now facilitated by technological advances such as Google Maps (Bonet,"
195,23,"         Munoz, and Pineda Mannheim 2014; Norregaard 2015). Valuation of properties"
195,24,"         is especially difficult in less developed countries, with high degrees of infor-"
195,25,"         mality (unregistered properties, frequently transacted on a cash basis). The"
195,26,"         difficulties are further compounded by the fact that property taxes are generally"
195,27,"         assigned to local authorities, whose administrative capacities, especially in small"
195,28,"         rural municipalities, are weaker than at the national level."
195,29,"      •• Visibility and compliance costs. Typically, recurrent property taxes are paid in"
195,30,"         annual or semiannual installments, which makes them very visible and can give"
195,31,"         rise to liquidity constraints. Such constraints may also arise with nonrecurring"
195,32,"         wealth taxes such as those on gifts and inheritance."
195,33,"      •• Taxpayer perceptions. Taxpayers may perceive property valuations as unfair,"
195,34,"         especially in the absence of objective, market price–based indicators of prop-"
195,35,"         erty value."
195,36,"      These characteristics contribute to make property taxes particularly unpopular with"
195,37,"both taxpayers and politicians. For these reasons, and especially given their assignment"
195,38,"to local governments, property taxes do not appear to be good candidates for funding a"
195,39,"UBI, at least not in the foreseeable future."
195,40,"      Given the cross-border mobility of financial wealth, the scope for mobilizing sig-"
195,41,"nificant resources through other forms of wealth taxation, such as taxes on net worth or"
195,42,
196,1,"172                                                                               Teresa Ter-Minassian"
196,2,"financial assets, would appear to hinge on developing a broad-based international con-"
196,3,"sensus on the desirability of such taxes. In the absence of international coordination,"
196,4,"which is currently nonexistent, cross-border competition is likely to severely constrain"
196,5,"individual countries’ maneuvering room in this area."
196,6,"Taxes on Consumption"
196,7,"General taxes on consumption, particularly the value-added tax (VAT), are the workhorse"
196,8,"of taxation systems, especially in emerging market and low-income countries. In emerg-"
196,9,"ing market economies, their yield (at over 6.5 percent of GDP) is comparable to the"
196,10,"average in advanced ones, and accounts for a third of tax revenues. In low-income coun-"
196,11,"tries (at 4.8 percent of GDP) it accounts for over 30 percent of tax revenues. Excise taxes"
196,12,"also play a significant role in revenue mobilization, accounting on average for about one-"
196,13,"tenth of total tax revenues in all three groups of countries (figure 5.10)."
196,14,"       The broad worldwide reliance on consumption taxes reflects the fact that they are"
196,15,"relatively efficiency- and growth-friendly, easier to administer than income or wealth"
196,16,"taxes, and generally less visible than other revenue sources. Excises, by being levied on"
196,17,"goods that have adverse side effects on health (such as tobacco and alcoholic or soda bev-"
196,18,"erages), often serve complementary policy objectives in addition to revenue generation."
196,19,"       Consumption-based taxes are, however, inferior to income and wealth taxes from"
196,20,"a distributional standpoint. A broad-based single-rate VAT is regressive with respect to"
196,21,"current income, because consumption tends to decline as a proportion of income as the"
196,22,"latter rises. However, some empirical studies have found it to be proportional or even"
196,23,"slightly progressive in relation to consumption and to lifetime incomes."
196,24,"       Concern with the potential distributional impact of a broad-based, single-rate VAT"
196,25,"has prompted a number of countries to exempt, or subject to reduced rates, items such"
196,26,"as some or most foods, and educational and health goods and services. Empirical studies"
196,27,"of the distributional effects of such tax expenditures suggest that, while these goods may"
196,28,"represent a larger proportion of the consumption of poorer households, the lost revenue"
196,29,"disproportionately benefits the middle and upper quintiles of the income distribution"

197,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                    173"
197,2,"(Corbacho, Cibils, and Lora 2013; Keen 2015; Lustig 2017). Thus, while these tax expen-"
197,3,"ditures (which in some countries are equivalent to a significant fraction of GDP) are"
197,4,"progressive, they redistribute in favor of the middle and upper classes. Moreover, exten-"
197,5,"sive exemptions and multiple rates substantially complicate VAT administration."
197,6,"      The empirical evidence on the distributional impact of excises is mixed, reflecting"
197,7,"varying patterns of consumption of the taxed products in different countries. Excises"
197,8,"on tobacco are generally found to be regressive, while those on alcohol are regressive in"
197,9,"some countries and mildly progressive in others."
197,10,"      It is clear from the considerations above that policy makers considering financing a"
197,11,"UBI with increases in taxes on consumption would need to carefully weigh their potential"
197,12,"advantages and disadvantages. If a country already has a broad-based VAT with a moder-"
197,13,"ate single rate, a relatively small increase in that rate could yield significant revenue with"
197,14,"limited costs in terms of efficiency and ease of administration and compliance. If the VAT"
197,15,"base is eroded by significant exemptions, or if there are several different rates, a reduc-"
197,16,"tion of the exemptions or a simplification of the rate structure would yield gains not only"
197,17,"in terms of revenue, but also with regard to efficiency and administration."
197,18,"      In both cases, the distributional effects of the proposed changes in the VAT base"
197,19,"and rate(s) should be assessed, together with those in the UBI, through microsimulations"
197,20,"based on available household expenditure surveys and standard assumptions on the"
197,21,"pass-through of the changes onto consumer prices.18"
197,22,"      A recent paper (Harris et al. 2018) presents some such simulations, which indi-"
197,23,"cate that broadening the VAT base and using the revenue to fund a UBI would boost"
197,24,"the consumption of the least-well-off households and reduce extreme poverty and"
197,25,"inequality—even if only 75 percent of the additional revenue was used for this purpose."
197,26,"Chapter 4 also provides examples of such simulations, which suggest that in some cases"
197,27,"the combination of a more generous UBI with a proportional increase in indirect tax"
197,28,"rates can reduce poverty and inequality, albeit of course less so than a comparable com-"
197,29,"bination of UBI and increased PIT."
197,30,"Other Potential Revenue Sources"
197,31,"Environmental Taxes"
197,32,"Environmental taxes are another potential source of revenue to finance a UBI. These"
197,33,"taxes are more prevalent in advanced than in developing economies (many of which, as"
197,34,"discussed in the next section, still subsidize the consumption of pollutants such as fuels)"
197,35,"and can take different forms, the most common being excises on fuels used for transport"
197,36,"and heating, and on electricity.19"
197,37,"      A recent OECD study, covering 42 advanced and large emerging market economies"
197,38,"that together account for about 80 percent of global energy use and the related carbon"
197,39,"emissions, finds that the coverage and magnitude of energy taxes have been rising in"
197,40,"recent years, but on average they remain relatively low from an environmental stand-"
197,41,"point, covering only a fraction of the environmental costs of the energy use (OECD 2018)."
197,42,
198,1,"174                                                                     Teresa Ter-Minassian"
198,2,"       These taxes vary widely, however, across countries, sectors, and products (OECD"
198,3,"2018). They tend to be larger in higher per capita income countries, with some notable"
198,4,"exceptions such as the United States. They are typically very low on (highly polluting)"
198,5,"coal, which remains the key input for electricity generation in many countries, and"
198,6,"higher on fuels used in transportation. Even among the latter, there are variations across"
198,7,"products, with diesel tending to be more lightly taxed than gasoline, despite its higher"
198,8,"polluting effects. These differences, which distort energy consumption patterns, have"
198,9,"tended to be reduced in more recent years."
198,10,"       Environmental taxes have obvious benefits in terms of efficiency, since they charge"
198,11,"for environmental externalities, and also have significant revenue-raising potential. Espe-"
198,12,"cially in their excise form, they are easy to administer and entail low compliance costs."
198,13,"Recent empirical studies (e.g., Flues and Lutz 2015) also do not find evidence of a signif-"
198,14,"icant adverse impact on countries’ international competitiveness."
198,15,"       The main obstacle to raising environmental taxes to levels closer to covering the"
198,16,"environmental costs of energy use has traditionally been concern over their distribu-"
198,17,"tional impact. However, such an impact can be expected to vary across products and"
198,18,"countries, reflecting varying patterns of energy consumption. Moreover, mitigating steps"
198,19,"can be taken to reduce any adverse effects of the taxes on poorer income classes."
198,20,"       Recent OECD research (Flues and Thomas 2015; Flues and van Dender 2017) using"
198,21,"microsimulation models suggests that, in 21 advanced (mainly European) economies,"
198,22,"transport taxes tend to be progressive in terms of consumption in the first half or more"
198,23,"of the distribution—which is not surprising, since many poor households do not own"
198,24,"a vehicle. The taxes’ progressivity is likely to be even greater in low-income countries,"
198,25,"where car ownership tends to be concentrated in the upper income classes. Taxes on"
198,26,"heating fuels are generally found to be somewhat regressive, as are taxes on electricity"
198,27,"consumption. The latter, however, can be made less regressive by exempting electricity"
198,28,"consumption below a minimum threshold."
198,29,"       As with other taxes, any adverse distributional effects should be weighed against"
198,30,"the distributional benefits of the expenditures they finance. Policy makers considering"
198,31,"financing a UBI with the introduction or increase in environmental taxes would need to"
198,32,"analyze the combined impact of the two measures on the distribution of incomes and"
198,33,"consumption (Parry 2015). If the net effect is distributionally positive—as is likely to be"
198,34,"the case especially in emerging market and low-income countries—environmental taxes"
198,35,"would seem to have much to recommend them."
198,36,"Nontax Revenues"
198,37,"Unfortunately, there appears to be only limited potential to use nontax revenues to"
198,38,"finance a UBI. As indicated above, the volatility of royalties from natural resource rev-"
198,39,"enues makes them unsuitable to fund a benefit aiming to provide a stable and secure"
198,40,"source of income to the population."
198,41,"       User fees for public services are recommendable on efficiency grounds, but tend to"
198,42,"be highly visible and therefore resisted by citizens—especially when levied for nationally"
198,43,
199,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                   175"
199,2,"provided services, where their link to the accessibility and quality of the service is fre-"
199,3,"quently unclear. For this reason, user fees tend to be more utilized by local governments,"
199,4,"which makes them unsuitable to finance a nationwide UBI."
199,5,"      In principle, a fairly steady stream of revenues could be obtained through better utili-"
199,6,"zation of the commercial assets owned by governments, including state-owned enterprises,"
199,7,"real estate, and some natural resources.20 Setting up the required governance structures is,"
199,8,"however, a task that is likely to require substantial time and political commitment. Also,"
199,9,"many such assets belong to subnational levels of government (e.g., cities). The scope for"
199,10,"funding a UBI through this type of revenue is thus likely to be highly country specific."
199,11,"      Foreign aid could in theory represent an additional funding source for a UBI in"
199,12,"low-income countries. Indeed, some donors might find the prospect of consolidating"
199,13,"a number of different aid programs into one supporting a unified cash transfer mech-"
199,14,"anism attractive, with lower administrative costs and risks of leakages (e.g., through"
199,15,"corruption). Others might find it a difficult political “sell” at home—funding a program"
199,16,"that also provides benefits to high-income recipients. In all cases, in the current envi-"
199,17,"ronment of budget consolidation in traditional donor countries, it may be difficult for"
199,18,"low-income countries to secure significant increases in the total amount of foreign aid"
199,19,"they receive. Therefore, foreign aid may not offer much scope to increase the generosity"
199,20,"of the social safety net through the introduction of a UBI."
199,21,"Conclusions"
199,22,"This chapter emphasizes that decisions about a UBI should be taken in conjunction with"
199,23,"decisions about its financing, as alternative financing options can be expected to have"
199,24,"quite different macroeconomic, fiscal, and distributional effects that could reinforce or"
199,25,"offset those of the UBI. Those effects would reflect a range of economic, demographic,"
199,26,"social, and institutional factors that are likely to be highly country specific."
199,27,"      Drawing on relevant theoretical literature and international experiences, the chap-"
199,28,"ter discusses considerations and criteria that can guide the analysis of the effects of"
199,29,"various financing options in individual emerging market or low-income countries. It is"
199,30,"crucial to extend this analysis to a sufficiently long time horizon, given the fact that a"
199,31,"UBI is intended to provide households a permanent, stable, and predictable source of"
199,32,"revenue. Policy makers should resist the likely temptation to use a temporary fiscal space"
199,33,"created by easy financing conditions to fund a program that would need to continue if"
199,34,"and when those conditions disappeared."
199,35,"      The chapter first looked at how to assess available fiscal space to fund a non-"
199,36,"budget-neutral UBI on current tax and expenditure policies, taking into account both"
199,37,"short-term financing constraints and longer-term fiscal sustainability, and concludes that"
199,38,"such an option is unlikely to be viable in most circumstances—especially given the fact"
199,39,"that (as suggested by the microsimulations in chapter 4) in many countries the fiscal cost"
199,40,"of a nonbudget-neutral UBI that would adequately protect the poor is likely to exceed"
199,41,"several points of GDP."
199,42,
200,1,"176                                                                      Teresa Ter-Minassian"
200,2,"      Accordingly, the chapter then focused on possible measures to augment the fiscal"
200,3,"space for a UBI through savings in other expenditures and increases in revenues. On the"
200,4,"expenditure side, two important candidates for savings are subsidies and government"
200,5,"wages."
200,6,"      Despite reforms in a number of countries to reduce energy subsidies in recent"
200,7,"years, they remain significant (in excess of 2 percent of GDP) in several middle- and"
200,8,"low-income countries, especially oil producers. They have a range of well-recognized"
200,9,"costs in terms of environmental and health externalities, distortions in the productive"
200,10,"structure of a country, balance of payments, and preemption of fiscal space that could"
200,11,"be used for productive and social spending."
200,12,"      Although some fuel products weigh significantly in the consumption basket of the"
200,13,"poor, the bulk of energy subsidies benefits middle- and upper-income groups, a fact that"
200,14,"complicates the political economy of their reform. The introduction of an appropriately"
200,15,"calibrated UBI may facilitate such a reform, insofar as it would allow partial compensa-"
200,16,"tion of these groups, in addition to full compensation of the affected poor."
200,17,"      The chapter highlights a range of options for reform in employment and wage"
200,18,"policies for the civil service that—although unlikely to yield substantial savings in the"
200,19,"short run—could do so over the medium term on a more sustainable basis. Realism"
200,20,"about their feasibility, their distributional impact, and the extent and time profile of"
200,21,"their expected budgetary payoffs would be essential in assessing the suitability of such"
200,22,"reforms as sources of financing for a proposed UBI in individual countries."
200,23,"      With regard to revenue measures, the chapter’s main takeaways can be summa-"
200,24,"rized as follows:"
200,25,"      •• In assessing the appropriateness and scope of revenue-raising measures to fund"
200,26,"         a UBI, the focus should be on the impact of any proposed tax package on the"
200,27,"         progressivity of the entire tax system."
200,28,"      •• In general, steps to broaden the tax base should be preferred to increases in"
200,29,"         rates, because they are more efficiency-friendly, improve horizontal equity, and"
200,30,"         facilitate tax administration; but changes in tax schedules may also be appropri-"
200,31,"         ate in some circumstances."
200,32,"      •• In terms of the PIT, there is frequently scope for raising revenue in an efficiency-"
200,33,"         and distribution-friendly way by lowering a too-high exemption threshold,"
200,34,"         eliminating or reducing deductions and exclusions from the tax base that ben-"
200,35,"         efit primarily the upper-income classes, and taxing capital income and capital"
200,36,"         gains at a moderate rate that does not encourage capital flight. This scope is"
200,37,"         likely to be significantly constrained in many emerging market and low-income"
200,38,"         countries by the high degrees of informality prevailing in those economies, and"
200,39,"         by the foreseeable resistance to sizable increases in the tax burden by upper-in-"
200,40,"         come groups, which wield considerable political clout in those countries."
200,41,"      •• The CIT does not currently seem a good source of funding for a UBI, given its"
200,42,
201,1,"Chapter 5. Financing a Universal Basic Income: A Primer                                           177"
201,2,"         volatility, especially in countries dependent on natural resource revenues, and"
201,3,"         the still high degree of international tax competition."
201,4,"      •• Taxes on property and wealth are desirable from a distributional standpoint, but"
201,5,"         difficult to administer and highly unpopular politically. Therefore, they tend to"
201,6,"         produce limited revenue, especially in non-advanced countries. Also, they are"
201,7,"         frequently assigned to subnational governments, a fact that makes them unsuit-"
201,8,"         able to fund a nationwide UBI."
201,9,"      •• Consumption taxes are recommendable on efficiency grounds, and typically"
201,10,"         have substantial revenue mobilization potential, but they entail distributional"
201,11,"         costs in many instances. Their increase may be more distribution-friendly if"
201,12,"         coupled with an increase in the generosity of the social safety net through the"
201,13,"         introduction of a UBI."
201,14,"      •• “Green” taxes are a thus far underutilized instrument that could provide a useful"
201,15,"         revenue source for a UBI."
201,16,"      •• The scope to raise various types of nontax revenues to fund a proposed UBI"
201,17,"         appears limited for the foreseeable future."
201,18,"      In conclusion, financing a nonbudget-neutral UBI in a fiscally sustainable way"
201,19,"would represent a substantial, and for low-income countries with high poverty incidence"
201,20,"daunting, challenge. Even in countries with lower poverty incidence, and thus a more"
201,21,"manageable fiscal cost, sustainable financing of a UBI would require the simultaneous"
201,22,"use of several of the policy options discussed in this chapter—in particular both signif-"
201,23,"icant savings in other spending programs and increases in income and consumption"
201,24,"taxes. This in turn would significantly complicate the political economy of introducing a"
201,25,"UBI—the subject of the next chapter—as it would require securing the support of multi-"
201,26,"ple groups of stakeholders."

202,4,"4.  Regarding debt composition, countries with high shares of variable rate, foreign exchange–"
202,5,"    denominated, or foreign-held debt would tend to be more vulnerable to changes in domestic"
202,6,"    interest rates or in risk premiums for their debt. For emerging market economies, the Inter-"
202,7,"    national Monetary Fund considers a share of the public debt denominated in foreign currency"
202,8,"    as signaling moderate risk if it is above 20 percent, and high risk if it is above 60 percent. The"
202,9,"    corresponding ratios for the share of the public debt held by nonresidents are 15 percent and"
202,10,"    45 percent, respectively (IMF 2013)."
202,11,"5.  The International Monetary Fund considers countries with public gross financing require-"

202,17,"7.  The relevance of such benchmarking hinges crucially on the choice of the comparator coun-"
202,18,"    tries. These should indeed be comparable to the country in question, not only in terms of level"
202,19,"    of development, but also in terms of size; geographic, demographic, and social characteris-"

202,29,"    for market and disposable incomes on average in the OECD, with the other three-quarters"
202,30,"    accounted for by cash transfers (Brys et al. 2016)."

202,36,"    study estimates that total tax expenditures in the region average about 3.5 percent of GDP,"
202,37,"    of which 0.6 percentage points are accounted for by the PIT. There is substantial variation"
202,38,"    around these averages. In some countries, tax expenditures under the PIT result in revenue"

207,6,"        his chapter discusses the political feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI)"
207,7,"        from a broad political economy perspective. In recent years, political interest in"
207,8,"        UBI has grown exponentially, with local, regional, and national decision makers"
207,9,"        initiating UBI experiments.1 Elsewhere, governments or political actors have com-"
207,10,"missioned high-level reports examining the case for UBI.2 Chapter 1 provides details of"
207,11,"these developments in countries as diverse as Finland, India, the Islamic Republic of"
207,12,"Iran, Kenya, Mongolia, and the United States."
207,13,"       Political decisions are typically grounded in economic interests. The net gains or"
207,14,"losses from the introduction of UBI will depend on its financing and the performance of"
207,15,"programs it replaces. Financing a meaningful level of UBI requires mobilizing additional"
207,16,"funds; how progressive the tax regime is determines the distribution of gains and losses"
207,17,"from the UBI.3 If a larger share of taxes is paid by the rich, the absolute majority of the"
207,18,"population is likely to gain from introduction of a UBI. In a democratic system where"
207,19,"voters follow their interests, one can predict that policy makers who institute a UBI are"
207,20,"likely to enjoy increased political support; such a mechanism is called a “feedback loop.”"
207,21,"       However, this simple view does not fully reflect reality. There is a growing body of"
207,22,"economic theory that seeks to predict (using economic modeling tools) political decision"
207,23,"making on policy choices (Commander 2012; Khemani 2017; World Bank 2008, 2016,"
207,24,"2017). Political economy analysis seeks to identify political factors that lead to instituting"
207,25,"and implementing a given policy. Such factors may relate to perceptions and values, the"
207,26,"institutional structure of the decision-making process, the political power or influence of"
207,27,"possible winners and losers, the credibility of proposed policy changes, and the effective-"
207,28,"ness of communication. The specific challenge for a UBI is that determining a technically"
207,29,"                                              183"

208,1,"184                                                    Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
208,2,"sound UBI proposal needs engagement with political philosophy and public preferences."
208,3,"Political institutions play a role in shaping societal preferences—that is, whether society"
208,4,"believes it is in everyone’s interest to institute a particular policy (Khemani 2017)."
208,5,"       Chapter 4’s policy simulations adopt a particular view as to the technical sound-"
208,6,"ness of a UBI proposal. It uses effects on poverty and income distribution (progressivity"
208,7,"of combined effects of transfers and financing) in making comparisons with the current"
208,8,"system as the criterion of whether a particular version of a UBI is better or worse than"
208,9,"the current system. This principle helps in discriminating among various alternatives."
208,10,"But citizens need not share the goals of using redistribution via a UBI to reduce poverty"
208,11,"and inequality (Khemani 2017). In the absence of a shared understanding of the goals"
208,12,"for redistribution, there is a real risk that any such policy would be captured by the"
208,13,"prevailing political elites regardless of its technical soundness, or that sound proposals"
208,14,"would be modified to serve narrow political objectives."
208,15,"       This chapter examines these factors and risks by simultaneously looking at demand-"
208,16,"and supply-side determinants of politics. We start with an exploration of the foundations"
208,17,"of demand for a policy by introducing the concept of constituency, which is rooted in"
208,18,"both economic interests and attitudinal factors. In the policy process, constituencies are"
208,19,"represented by coalitions of decision makers responsible for instituting policies. In the"
208,20,"policy process model we adopt here, the political feasibility of a policy proposal (a UBI"
208,21,"being one such proposal) depends on cementing its constituency (producing a robust"
208,22,"policy demand); this demand can lead to policy change if there is an enacting robust"
208,23,"coalition among decision makers willing and able to act on this demand (supply). The"
208,24,"enactment produces sustainable policy change if there is capacity for selecting the most"
208,25,"appropriate form and pathway for implementation. This simple framework mimics the"
208,26,"actual process of policy debate, adoption, and implementation (De Wispelaere and Mar-"
208,27,"tinelli 2017), similar to the operational view of the political economy developed by Fritz,"
208,28,"Levy, and Ort (2014).4"
208,29,"       One of the main features of the political process is path dependency. The literature"
208,30,"on the dynamics of policy development (e.g., Mahoney and Thelen 2015; Pierson 2000;"
208,31,"Steinmo 2010) suggests that political choices are limited by decisions made in the past."
208,32,"Such path dependency hinges both on the consolidation of vested interests wanting the"
208,33,"continuation of policies from which they benefit, and the formation of preferences and"
208,34,"beliefs (reflected in political ideologies) that motivate actions. Path dependency influ-"
208,35,"ences all social policy proposals, but it is clearly a major obstacle for the UBI, as it departs"
208,36,"from instituted social protection policies in a radical way."
208,37,"       Another factor influencing the politics of social protection are attitudes toward who"
208,38,"deserves to receive support from the state. “Deservingness” in social policy influences"
208,39,"what society considers fair (van Oorschot 2000, 2006). A UBI goes against beliefs that"
208,40,"social aid should be based on reciprocity, and that support is conditional on social action"
208,41,"by a recipient that makes him or her “earn” the right for such support. The idea of a UBI,"
208,42,"with its principle of unconditionality, means that assistance is “unearned.” These views"
208,43,"were expressed in a 1969 address to the nation by then–U.S. president Richard Nixon:"
208,44,
209,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                 185"
209,2,"       Under the guaranteed income proposal, everyone would be assured a minimum"
209,3,"       income, regardless of how much he was capable of earning, regardless of what his"
209,4,"       need was, regardless of whether or not he was willing to work."
209,5,"       Now, during the presidential campaign last year, I opposed such a plan. I oppose it"
209,6,"       now and I will continue to oppose it, and this is the reason: A guaranteed income"
209,7,"       would undermine the incentives to work…a guaranteed income establishes rights"
209,8,"       without any responsibilities. There is no reason why one person should be taxed so"
209,9,"       that another can choose to live idly. (quoted in Caputo 2012, 269)"
209,10,"       The majority of policy makers nowadays agree. By and large—but with some nota-"
209,11,"ble exceptions discussed in this chapter—major parties have not incorporated UBI into"
209,12,"their political platforms. The reaction against “free money” is strong across both devel-"
209,13,"oping and developed countries, and is independent of self-identification on a left-right"
209,14,"spectrum.5 However, the challenges faced by traditional social policy instruments of risk"
209,15,"management keeps resurrecting the idea of radical reform toward redistribution, includ-"
209,16,"ing through UBI. Hence, the political feasibility of UBI cannot be ruled out and needs to"
209,17,"be examined carefully."
209,18,"       The chapter is based on models of the political process depicting democratic"
209,19,"political regimes. Many developing countries have different polities, often labeled"
209,20,"“autocracies.” Closer inspection shows that the political process in an autocracy is not"
209,21,"diametrically opposite that in a democracy (Acemoglu and Robinson 2001; Commander"
209,22,"2012), and we offer in conclusion some considerations on the political economy of UBI"
209,23,"in low- and middle-income countries."
209,24,"A Stylized Model of Political Economy"
209,25,"This section outlines a stylized model for exploring the political economy of UBI drawing"
209,26,"from De Wispelaere and Martinelli (2017). The model consists of three main compo-"
209,27,"nents and their interrelations: constituencies, capabilities, and coalitions (figure 6.1)."
209,28,"       A constituency is a concept most closely associated with economic interests, or the"
209,29,"extent to which a group is a net beneficiary of a public policy. However, a constituency is"
209,30,"distinct from the concept of a beneficiary (De Wispelaere 2015). A beneficiary is a policy"
209,31,"category indicating those who are directly benefiting from a policy being instituted (e.g.,"
209,32,"net recipients of a UBI).6 The extent to which individuals benefit from a UBI will depend"
209,33,"on design parameters such as the level of the UBI, the funding mechanism, and—cru-"
209,34,"cially—what implications a UBI has on the existence of, or eligibility for, other social"
209,35,"programs. Chapter 4 shows that both the size of benefits and their incidence vary greatly"
209,36,"between income groups depending on the economic and social context."
209,37,"       A constituency, by contrast, is a political category that is both narrower and"
209,38,"broader than the set of beneficiaries. It is narrower because not all beneficiaries are will-"
209,39,"ing and able to expend political capital to pressure decision makers, creating an effective"
209,40,"demand for a policy that will trigger benefits (or costs). It is broader because not all who"

210,17,"be net contributors to a proposed transfer scheme may end up supporting it, perhaps"
210,18,"for reasons of solidarity or social justice. Key determinants for effective demand include,"
210,19,"among others, voter preferences and normative values, the number of potential benefi-"
210,20,"ciaries and losers from proposed reforms and their power resources, and the prospects"
210,21,"of forming meaningful coalitions of support and opposition."
210,22,"       The demand side is not only directly related to objective forces, but is also influ-"
210,23,"enced by expectations—for example, the strength of prevailing perceptions of labor"
210,24,"market dysfunction and the failure of existing welfare provisions to provide adequate"
210,25,"income security. Different groups of actors may view the policy problem in very different"
210,26,"terms, and this will color the extent to which support and opposition coalesce (see De"
210,27,"Wispelaere 2015; De Wispelaere and Martinelli 2017)."
210,28,"       Coalitions designate the political agents involved in the process to legislate for and"
210,29,"implement a policy (or oppose its adoption and implementation). Typically, this will"
210,30,"involve the governing party or coalition of parties. Support for a given policy proposal"
210,31,"may differ considerably within a ruling coalition of parties or even within a single party,"
210,32,"which can affect both the aggregate level of support at any given time and its robustness"
210,33,"over time.7 It depends crucially on the beliefs of policy makers about how other politi-"
210,34,"cal actors are behaving, as Khemani (2017) explains. Furthermore, implementation may"
210,35,
211,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                 187"
211,2,"require additional political support.8 Finally, the governing coalition—even with a consol-"
211,3,"idated position on a policy proposal—may need support from key stakeholders such as"
211,4,"trade unions, business organizations, and various civil society associations."
211,5,"      Coalitions are responsive to two different sets of political feasibility factors: one"
211,6,"set related to the demand for a policy proposal (or constituencies), the other set related"
211,7,"to the capacity to implement or supply it. Generally speaking, the supply side relates"
211,8,"to policies that political agents can feasibly offer to address voter demands, taking into"
211,9,"account constraints arising from fiscal capacities, bureaucratic capabilities, sunk costs of"
211,10,"previous policies, and institutional legacies attributable to the vested interests that these"
211,11,"cultivate (see Pierson 2003, 2004). Policy feedback effects can reinforce an existing tra-"
211,12,"jectory, leading to stability (see Bonoli and Palier 2000; Mettler and SoRelle 2014). While"
211,13,"this path dependency does not preclude significant reform, it limits the extent to which"
211,14,"we observe dramatic shifts in policy and explains why welfare reforms are usually of a"
211,15,"piecemeal nature."
211,16,"      The demand and supply determinants mutually influence each other. Structural"
211,17,"features in labor markets and social protection regimes facilitate or disrupt the creation"
211,18,"of robust constituencies demanding social policy reform. Similarly, constituencies will"
211,19,"put pressure to change. Coalitions in turn respond to both demand- and supply-side fac-"
211,20,"tors, while simultaneously trying to influence each in an attempt to further their own"
211,21,"goals (figure 6.1)."
211,22,"      Few considerations are needed to apply this model beyond typical democracies. In"
211,23,"an autocracy, political voices are more likely to be distorted because of narrow political"
211,24,"participation, low expectations, limited information on government policies, patronage,"
211,25,"and the salient role of noneconomic issues such as ethnicity or religion (Roemer 1998;"
211,26,"van de Walle 2014). Thus policy makers seem to have greater freedom of choice. But the"
211,27,"social contract in such settings is mostly founded on intragroup solidarity rather than"
211,28,"on the government-led provision of benefits and services. Support for the deserving is"
211,29,"predominantly provided through private solidarity networks shaped by kinship (Hill and"
211,30,"Verwimp 2017), making redistribution through UBI almost alien."
211,31,"      Because they face the threat of popular uprisings or divisions in ruling coalitions,"
211,32,"autocratic regimes also have incentives to secure support from and stability for the"
211,33,"majority of the population, including through extending social transfer programs (Lavers"
211,34,"and Hickey 2016). Nondemocratic polities tend to be those with high inequality in both"
211,35,"income and wealth distributions. To lower risks of upheaval or social turmoil, such gov-"
211,36,"ernments may choose to offer citizens some element of redistribution (Acemoglu and"
211,37,"Robinson 2001)."
211,38,"      The general model of the political process presented here is therefore also appli-"
211,39,"cable to autocratic regimes, with two possible modifications: feedback loops will be less"
211,40,"complex or weaker than in democratic systems, and the role of policy champions/lead-"
211,41,"ers/epistemic communities with genuine access to the governing institution will be a key"
211,42,"variable."
211,43,"      The particular relationship between constituencies, capabilities, and coalitions"
211,44,"influences the political feasibility of a specific policy proposal for a UBI (figure 6.2). To"

212,23,"mentation, we should expect coalitions to enact legislation and move on to practical"
212,24,"rollout of the policy (upper right quadrant of the figure). In this context, coalitions would"
212,25,"have good reasons to accommodate the demand for UBI and little reason to resist such"
212,26,"a policy shift. Purely ideological objections to UBI would come at a political and electoral"
212,27,"cost."
212,28,"      There is no country so far that would squarely fit into such a description. A plausi-"
212,29,"ble context for this scenario is where windfall gains (e.g., from natural resources) could"
212,30,"be universally distributed to all citizens or long-term residents in the form of a social"
212,31,"dividend (see Cummine 2016). As the case of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend illus-"
212,32,"trates, such social dividends create a strong demand, are relatively easy to administer,"
212,33,"and meet with comparatively less resistance—as in principle, everyone is a winner (Wid-"
212,34,"erquist and Howard 2012a, 2012b). The demand is likely to be stronger in cases where"
212,35,"resource rents are combined with minimal social protection (hence vested interest in"
212,36,"continuing current policies or allocating additional resources to them is weak), although"
212,37,"implementation problems due to a lack of infrastructure need to be overcome, as a short-"
212,38,"lived UBI experience in Mongolia, described in chapter 1, suggests.9"
212,39,"      Conversely, in a scenario where little demand exists and major policy or institu-"
212,40,"tional barriers impede its implementation, we would expect to see little political interest"
212,41,"in instituting a UBI (lower left quadrant of figure 6.2). In this scenario, there may exist"
212,42,"disparate calls for UBI by advocacy groups, but a genuine window of opportunity is not"
212,43,
213,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                               189"
213,2,"likely to open. Under these circumstances, most political agents would view moving"
213,3,"toward the implementation of a UBI as an exercise in futility—producing no real bene-"
213,4,"fits—or even prohibitively costly in political terms."
213,5,"       Low demand and limited capacity for UBI is a typical situation in most develop-"
213,6,"ing countries. The demand is low because of extremely limited fiscal resources and"
213,7,"many claims from other priorities, taking policy makers’ attention away from UBI pro-"
213,8,"posals and reducing public interest in generous universal social transfers. Capacity is low"
213,9,"because existing administrative systems have limited outreach or cannot mobilize suffi-"
213,10,"cient fiscal resources to make UBI meaningful."
213,11,"       In such contexts, calls for UBI arise from time to time from international (e.g.,"
213,12,"recently by UN Secretary-General António Guterres; see Yamamori 2018) or local propo-"
213,13,"nents. There are experiments that are often financed by donors (mostly private), driven"
213,14,"by politics in their home countries, rather than local demands.10 Advocates among policy"
213,15,"makers in developing countries may use this idea as part of their electoral campaigns,"
213,16,"but are seldom willing to assemble the three parts of the political process to implement"
213,17,"such proposals on a nationwide scale."
213,18,"       For example, the experiment on UBI in Namibia was operating in a squatter"
213,19,"community for two years with positive results that were widely publicized (CPI 2016)."
213,20,"However, even after a leading advocate for UBI in the country was appointed by the"
213,21,"newly elected president in 2015 as a minister of poverty eradication and social welfare,"
213,22,"the original plan for scaling up UBI was swept away and replaced by a program intended"
213,23,"to alleviate poverty through economic growth. This program, the Harambee Prosper-"
213,24,"ity Plan, focuses on graduation approaches through productive inclusion, and includes"
213,25,"the creation of a food bank and grants for young people conditional on participation in"
213,26,"this food bank and other community activities (which is in opposition to UBI principles)"
213,27,"(Coelho 2016). Periodic media reports that the ministry is still developing plans for a UBI"
213,28,"covering specific demographic groups are not commented on by officials (Bott 2017)."
213,29,"       In South Asia, following nongovernmental organization activity in neighboring"
213,30,"India piloting various versions of a UBI, Sri Lanka’s advocates for a UBI have launched a"
213,31,"number of experimental schemes, along with an advocacy campaign targeted to mem-"
213,32,"bers of the Parliament and Cabinet. In a public statement, Sri Lanka’s minister of finance"
213,33,"assured that the government would study the idea of unconditional UBI in depth (Rice"
213,34,"2018). The deputy director general of the Department of Planning of the Sri Lankan gov-"
213,35,"ernment also expressed interest in the scheme and requested academics to evaluate its"
213,36,"results. No further political commitments were offered."
213,37,"       The UBI experiment in Kenya described in appendix A is supported by an interna-"
213,38,"tional nongovernmental organization, GiveDirectly, and has a sizable reach (over 20,000"
213,39,"recipients over 12 years).11 So far, however, country officials have not commented on the"
213,40,"pilot. Instead, the government is stepping up its efforts to expand social pensions—pos-"
213,41,"sibly the only politically viable alternative to the UBI and a competing program in terms"
213,42,"of fiscal resources (Douillard 2017)."
213,43,"       Moving to a different diagonal of figure 6.2, we see that many developed and some"
213,44,"middle-income countries experience stronger and more pronounced demands for UBI,"
213,45,
214,1,"190                                                   Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
214,2,"but at the same time have weak experience and capacity to implement it (upper left"
214,3,"quadrant of the figure). Developed countries have stronger capacity to implement a UBI,"
214,4,"but the demand for it as a redistributive policy is limited by preferences, beliefs, and ide-"
214,5,"ologies, all reflected in institutions (lower right quadrant)."
214,6,"       At the extremes, strong demand for UBI is met with rigid structural barriers (or lack"
214,7,"of capacity)—or conversely, high capabilities to institute a UBI run against low demand"
214,8,"(De Wispelaere and Martinelli 2017). These situations are depicted as a demand-capac-"
214,9,"ity paradox, a term coined by Parolin and Siöland (2018). The scenario of high demand"
214,10,"but low capacity is represented in southern European welfare states (see Noguera 2019"
214,11,"on Spain). Some transition economies of Eastern Europe have recently begun debating"
214,12,"a UBI, including Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation.12 The idea"
214,13,"has achieved some traction in Latin America (especially in Brazil and Mexico, as docu-"
214,14,"mented in Caputo 2012), and has become prominent in India (as detailed in chapter 1 of"
214,15,"this book). The opposite scenario of high capacity but low demand is exemplified in the"
214,16,"developed high-income countries, especially northern European states. The idea of a UBI"
214,17,"entered the policy-making arena some time ago in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland,"
214,18,"France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States, but failed to gain any trac-"
214,19,"tion in terms of real policy reform (Caputo 2012). The fiscal and institutional capacity to"
214,20,"deliver a UBI especially exists in the Nordic countries, but their populations and policy"
214,21,"makers are generally skeptical about its virtues; moreover, a sufficient degree of redistri-"
214,22,"bution already exists that makes a UBI largely redundant."
214,23,"       Select cases illustrate how, in the presence of the demand-capacity paradox, a UBI"
214,24,"features in policy debates. For example, in 2017–18, the Russian media vehemently"
214,25,"debated the idea of a UBI following an opinion poll in which 62 percent of respondents"
214,26,"declared themselves to be in favor of it, suggesting some demand exists. There are small-"
214,27,"scale privately financed experiments in Moscow reflecting an interest in the idea in some"
214,28,"circles. One of the leading economic and social policy think tanks in Russia organized an"
214,29,"international conference on UBI in 2018 with prominent policy advisors expressing their"
214,30,"views.13 All in all, the majority of experts expressed strong reservations about the desir-"
214,31,"ability of a UBI in Russia’s current political and governance context."
214,32,"       The reluctance of Russian academics to support a UBI as a policy idea may seem"
214,33,"surprising given the inefficiency of the country’s existing social assistance system; as"
214,34,"illustrated in chapter 4 of this book, Russia is an exceptional case, where UBI can lead"
214,35,"to improved welfare outcomes for the poor compared to the status quo. Reasons given"
214,36,"for this reluctance include a lack of trust in institutions to implement a UBI, suggest-"
214,37,"ing low capacity as the limiting factor. Another factor is strong path dependency: the"
214,38,"public may entertain an idea of a UBI in a certain context, but opinion polls in Russian"
214,39,"regions suggest very strong support for the existing merit-based system of redistribution"
214,40,"and opposition to a pro-poor shift (Yemtsov et al. 2019). Disillusionment with egalitar-"
214,41,"ian forms of social policy, inherited from communism, tarnish UBI proposals to provide"
214,42,"everyone with the same transfer."
214,43,"       In all of these scenarios, a prudent coalition would offer only a weak endorsement"
214,44,"for UBI. Such weak endorsement can take the form of offering to experiment with the"
214,45,
215,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                 191"
215,2,"policy without making a commitment to actual policy implementation; this is discussed"
215,3,"later in this chapter."
215,4,"Constituencies, Ideologies, and Coalitions"
215,5,"The political feasibility of a UBI depends on the existence of a significant constituency"
215,6,"that produces a strong political demand for the policy. As already discussed, constitu-"
215,7,"ency is ultimately built on net gains from a policy proposal compared to the status quo."
215,8,"       Such gains primarily take an economic form. Chapter 4 shows that for many"
215,9,"examples of country contexts in UBI simulation and financing scenarios, there are a"
215,10,"considerable number of losers.14 The size of their losses depends on the incidence of"
215,11,"transfers the UBI is replacing and on the taxes. In Brazil, Chile, India, Kazakhstan, Russia,"
215,12,"or South Africa, at least 20 percent of the population will be worse off if some of the"
215,13,"current social assistance transfers are replaced with a UBI. When the UBI is set at a level"
215,14,"higher than current transfers and financed by taxes, it is mostly the upper deciles that"
215,15,"are the losers. Their losses are sufficient to be a mobilizing factor in actively opposing"
215,16,"the introduction of such policies. But there are also groups that will benefit from the UBI,"
215,17,"and those can span the poor (especially those currently excluded from social welfare)"
215,18,"and the middle classes. Hence, building a robust constituency in support of a UBI is pos-"
215,19,"sible in principle."
215,20,"       The next question to be addressed in assessing the scale of a potential constituency"
215,21,"for a UBI proposal is assessment of attitudes to the idea. Several national and interna-"
215,22,"tional polls collect information on attitudes toward various social policy proposals, and"
215,23,"the concept of a UBI has recently been included in such polls. The results show that the"
215,24,"public across countries is rather favorable to the idea, and that this support is increasing."
215,25,"Today, 48 percent of Americans support it, according to a new Northeastern Univer-"
215,26,"sity/Gallup survey of more than 3,000 U.S. adults (Nova 2018). In Canada, a recent poll"
215,27,"shows that 57 percent of respondents support a minimal UBI proposal.15 In the United"
215,28,"Kingdom, 49 percent of respondents supported the introduction of a UBI calibrated to"
215,29,"minimum needs; this support drops to 30 percent, however, when financing through"
215,30,"taxes is considered (Ipsos MORI 2017). In 2016, Dalia Research conducted a large survey"
215,31,"of 28 European countries, with 64 percent of the respondents adopting a favorable view"
215,32,"about a UBI proposal, and 24 percent opposing it (Holmes 2017; for further discussion,"
215,33,"see Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2017)."
215,34,"       The latest wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) also included a question about"
215,35,"support for UBI, also with overall favorable responses: 47 percent in favor; 8 percent"
215,36,"strongly in favor (see Fitzgerald 2017; Vlandas 2018). There was significant variation"
215,37,"across countries surveyed, with Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland being least support-"
215,38,"ive and Eastern Europe most in favor.16 UBI support in all countries exhibits a strong age"
215,39,"distribution: the young are most favorably inclined, while those at retirement age and"
215,40,"the working-age population are less enthusiastic. There is a significant income gradi-"
215,41,"ent, with those at the lower end of the income distribution favoring a UBI compared to"
215,42,
216,1,"192                                                Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
216,2,"those higher up on the income scale. In addition, there is important variation by source"
216,3,"of income, with those receiving unemployment benefits (65 percent) and social bene-"
216,4,"fits (66 percent) expressing the most support, and those with income from investments"
216,5,"and/or savings expressing the least (37 percent).17 Labor market position is also strongly"
216,6,"associated with UBI support. Specifically, in the ESS, those who have experienced unem-"
216,7,"ployment in the last five years (65 percent) are vastly more supportive of UBI than those"
216,8,"who have not (56 percent).18 Among those in employment, the ESS finds mild variation"
216,9,"depending on current employment status (employee versus self-employed) and type of"
216,10,"employment contract (permanent versus temporary)."
216,11,"       Strong support from those who are currently unemployed, or have experienced"
216,12,"unemployment recently, is perhaps unsurprising.19 The unemployed have everything to"
216,13,"gain from a UBI scheme that offers an economic floor without delay or gaps in payment,"
216,14,"provides long-term income security, and avoids stigmatizing conditionality. But in most"
216,15,"countries, the unemployed are a relatively small and heterogeneous category without"
216,16,"much political clout, and form a weak basis for building a UBI constituency. A potential"
216,17,"expanded constituency might also include those in precarious and nonstandard employ-"
216,18,"ment, often referred to as the “precariat.”20 Precarious employment captures a variety"
216,19,"of nonstandard contracts, differing extensively in terms of pay or working conditions as"
216,20,"well as—importantly—access to social benefits (see Kalleberg 2018). Those working on"
216,21,"temporary contracts have different needs and views than those with part-time contracts;"
216,22,"these are expressed in the levels of support for a UBI among different groups of precar-"
216,23,"ious workers.21 In terms of building a robust political constituency demanding UBI, the"
216,24,"inclusion of different groups of precarious workers will depend on what policy alterna-"
216,25,"tives are available to promote the job or economic security of, for instance, temporary"
216,26,"workers compared to part-time workers.22"
216,27,"       In the UBI debate, labor market risk is closely associated with the increasing"
216,28,"automation of routinized labor (Reich 2015; Stern 2016; Walker 2016); this involves"
216,29,"high-skilled outsiders unable to find permanent employment (Häusermann, Kurer, and"
216,30,"Schwander 2015; Wren and Rehm 2014). This avenue may be less promising than UBI"
216,31,"advocates suggest. A study of attitudes toward unconditionality among various groups of"
216,32,"labor market outsiders confirms a strong gap between support for UBI for those who face"
216,33,"labor market disadvantage compared to those who face labor market risk. Chrisp and De"
216,34,"Wispelaere (2017) use 2008 European Value Studies data to examine attitudes toward"
216,35,"conditionality among a cluster of outsiders in 18 European countries. In their study,"
216,36,"unemployment was strongly associated with an aversion toward conditionality, but this"
216,37,"association is absent with those in one of the at-risk categories. This finding suggests"
216,38,"increased labor market risk as such does not translate into stronger support for UBI, in"
216,39,"contrast with the actual experience of labor market disadvantage."
216,40,"       In the UBI debate, the three different labor market positions outlined above are"
216,41,"assumed to have a strong preference for UBI. However, insights from the ESS and related"
216,42,"research do not bear this out. Heterogeneity within and across these labor market groups"
216,43,"makes it difficult to assume that they will converge around a clearly demarcated UBI pro-"
216,44,"posal."
216,45,
217,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                193"
217,2,"        Further, realistic differentiated UBI models based on different levels of UBI, vari-"
217,3,"ation in tax rates, and whether UBI replaces other social support schemes show that"
217,4,"even in developed countries demand for UBI drops significantly (Ipsos MORI 2017;"
217,5,"Pulkka 2018). And expanding the search for a UBI constituency to include the middle"
217,6,"classes runs into a paradox. Social history and comparative political economy research"
217,7,"has demonstrated that the middle classes have a critical role to play in siding with the"
217,8,"working classes to install social protection programs and increase social spending (Bald-"
217,9,"win 1990; Korpi and Palme 1998). But over time, the middle classes tend to capture"
217,10,"a progressively larger share of social spending by supporting contribution-based and"
217,11,"earnings-related social insurance programs over means-tested and tax-financed social"
217,12,"assistance—which is contrary to the underlying financing logic of UBI (Desai and Kharas"
217,13,"2017). This “Matthew effect”23 in social protection bodes ill for the prospects of building"
217,14,"an expanded UBI constituency including the middle classes.24"
217,15,"        The challenge of identifying a constituency for UBI in low- and middle-income"
217,16,"countries appears even more daunting. Polls in developing countries that assess atti-"
217,17,"tudes toward redistribution via transfers are very rare, but when they are done, they"
217,18,"show a much lower level of support than in developed countries. A recent example"
217,19,"from Indian states shows support for cash transfers as opposed to almost any alterna-"
217,20,"tive public policy is notoriously low (Khemani, Habyarimana, and Nooruddin 2019). As"
217,21,"shown by Bossuroy and Coudouel (2018), many societal groups across the African conti-"
217,22,"nent express deeply entrenched prejudices against redistribution by the state and share"
217,23,"a fear of the dependency and laziness any unearned income is perceived to generate."
217,24,"UBI experiments in Kenya and Namibia have so far not led to any clear political constit-"
217,25,"uency for UBI in these contexts."
217,26,"        Advocates of UBI often depict themselves as humanists embracing universal values"
217,27,"radically different from the world of actual politics.25 However, for a UBI to become a real-"
217,28,"ity, it must enter the world of realpolitik and be mapped to existing political forces and"
217,29,"ideologies (De Wispelaere 2015)."
217,30,"        Advocates of UBI attack many aspects of social transfers—their targeting, condi-"
217,31,"tionalities, work requirements, limited generosity, time-bound nature—all of which are"
217,32,"antithetical to the idea of a UBI. They seldom analyze the origins of these design fea-"
217,33,"tures, which most of the time are introduced to respond to political considerations. This"
217,34,"chapter offers a more impartial perspective on the UBI as a specific form of social pro-"
217,35,"tection instrument, and hence is primarily focused on politics of implementation and"
217,36,"not on ideological underpinnings. However, in order to understand demand for UBI, it is"
217,37,"necessary to see how different ideologies react to a UBI."
217,38,"        Mapping the UBI on ideologies is tricky—in fact, any ideological faction has both"
217,39,"proponents and adversaries of UBI and there is not a single ideology that can be counted"
217,40,"as the “main” defender. Nevertheless, some clear patterns have started to emerge (see"
217,41,"Torry 2016)."
217,42,"        Right-wing parties (pro-market “liberals” or religious “conservatives”) in general"
217,43,"have negative attitudes to redistribution. They also see “conditional” forms of social"
217,44,"transfer programs as desirable (see, e.g., Lindert and Vincensini 2010). More liberal"
217,45,
218,1,"194                                                 Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
218,2,"political ideologies have a more positive attitude to the UBI. This divide typically emerges"
218,3,"across countries and over time. For example, in the most recent Gallup poll in the United"
218,4,"States, 65 percent of those supporting Democrats want to see a UBI. In comparison, just"
218,5,"28 percent of Republicans support a UBI."
218,6,"       Despite a preference for narrow redistribution, UBI is becoming acceptable to con-"
218,7,"servative constituencies as a response to new threats to the traditional world of work"
218,8,"and family. Recently, several proposals for a UBI have originated among neo-liberals or"
218,9,"libertarians as a response to automation and increased unemployment, and these pro-"
218,10,"posals are coupled with the dismantling of the existing welfare state. For example, in"
218,11,"the United States, Charles Murray (2016) advocates for a UBI to be financed by getting"
218,12,"rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income,"
218,13,"housing subsidies, welfare for single women, and every other kind of welfare or social"
218,14,"service program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. Another strand"
218,15,"of support in favor of a UBI among right-wing parties is as a response to political pres-"
218,16,"sure to distribute natural resource rents or to overcome popular opposition to powerful"
218,17,"industrial interests.26"
218,18,"       Social democrats or representatives of organized labor have rather skeptical or"
218,19,"mixed views on the UBI.27 On the one hand, they see UBI as development of a “universal-"
218,20,"ist” welfare state (which they support), closing the last remaining loopholes that prevent"
218,21,"full inclusion in solidarity arrangements. On the other hand, as cogently expressed by"
218,22,"Birnbaum (2012), social democratic ideologies are strongly rooted in the value of work"
218,23,"and contributory principles. Trade unions also see threats from a UBI to their political"
218,24,"influence, stemming primarily from “opting out” because of the guaranteed income"
218,25,"offered by a UBI and its potential to exert downward pressure on wages. These parties"
218,26,"are concerned about a broader dismantling of time-tested welfare programs, institutions,"
218,27,"and principles. The liberal/conservative proposals for a UBI exacerbate this worry. In a"
218,28,"way, social democratic and left-wing parties see a UBI as a Trojan horse threatening the"
218,29,"existing welfare state, which they see as their main achievement."
218,30,"       However, once modified and adapted to serve the specific purposes of easing job"
218,31,"transitions or accumulation of human capital, UBI becomes an acceptable policy propo-"
218,32,"sition for this bloc. In some circumstances, socialists can even rally around the idea of a"
218,33,"UBI (as happened in the last presidential campaign in France28), building on the dissatis-"
218,34,"faction of voters with the current state of welfare regimes."
218,35,"       The most consistent support for the UBI comes from the green parties. The ecol-"
218,36,"ogist view of the objective of UBI is to allow a transition to new societal values that"
218,37,"demand reduced consumption and economic activity levels, and a greater role of the"
218,38,"state. This school of thought, which is often referred to as postproductivist, connects UBI"
218,39,"to green movements. The increasing political influence of green parties across Europe is"
218,40,"providing the main stimulus for the UBI as a policy project."
218,41,"       Going further to the left, Marxist scholars and political figures have a contradictory"
218,42,"attitude toward the UBI. On the one hand, it is seen as a promise for the liberation of"
218,43,"workers from their need to sell their labor (Wright 2010). Van der Veen and Van Parijs in"
218,44,"1986 published a classic article on UBI as the “capitalist road to communism,” and many"
218,45,
219,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                195"
219,2,"leftist ideologists continue to express this view (Goodman 2017). On the other hand, UBI"
219,3,"is regarded within this tradition as a highly suspicious plot of the oligarchy to buy social"
219,4,"peace and continue to exploit humanity, creating a fake sense of “social justice on the"
219,5,"cheap” (e.g., Piketty 2016). Hence, depending on the context and other political issues at"
219,6,"stake, they can take different attitudes toward the UBI—from supporting it to criticizing it."
219,7,"       Extreme right and nationalist parties do not have deeply rooted ideologies based"
219,8,"on theories of welfare. Rather, their opportunistic aim to amass more power and influ-"
219,9,"ence and radicalize the political discourse can feed on controversies around the UBI,29"
219,10,"especially if it is being connected to citizenship issues."
219,11,"       Political ideologies on the UBI and their changes over time have been well studied"
219,12,"in the case of Finland (box 6.1). The long history of debates around a UBI in that coun-"
219,13,"try produces many useful lessons in understanding the political factors driving changes"
219,14,"in reform coalitions."
219,15,"       The political evolution of the UBI debate in Finland shows an interesting phenome-"
219,16,"non: while left-wing parties are historically the driving force to push UBI on the agenda,"
219,17,"right-wing parties are the king makers. Left-wing political actors (including the center-left"
219,18,"Greens) may, in order to build a UBI coalition, pragmatically adopt a UBI model that"
219,19,"is moderately conservative and appeals to the political center. As Gibson and Goodin"
219,20,"(1999) have put it, the key for success in such heterogeneous coalitions is to adopt deci-"
219,21,"sions behind a “veil of vagueness,” where support remains broad."
219,22,"       Across-party-lines support for a UBI idea may lead to a coalition to institute new"
219,23,"policies. Box 6.2 discusses the introduction of universal child allowances in the United"
219,24,"Kingdom to show how support across the political spectrum can be mobilized even"
219,25,"when there are persistent differences in viewpoints regarding the objectives of a pro-"
219,26,"posed policy change."
219,27,"       It is evident from this overview that all parts of the political spectrum and ideolo-"
219,28,"gies may become favorable to the UBI idea or its modification, adapting it for specific"
219,29,"objectives. This is apparent in the European opinion polls, which suggest the ideological"
219,30,"position of an individual respondent does not explain individual-level support for UBI"
219,31,"(Fitzgerald 2017; Vlandas 2018). This broad appeal across the spectrum of political views"
219,32,"offers some interesting parallels to other ideas."
219,33,"       An example of a social protection idea having such broad appeal to different parts"
219,34,"of the political spectrum (with different objectives) is the history of conditional cash"
219,35,"transfers. As documented by Lindert and Vincensini (2010), the conditional cash trans-"
219,36,"fer in Brazil (Bolsa Família) appealed to both sides of the political spectrum. This broad"
219,37,"constituency made a coalition of support sufficiently stable to enable legislation and"
219,38,"successful implementation and scale-up, with positive feedback loops, rewarding policy"
219,39,"makers advancing the scale-up. Similar dynamics have been documented recently in"
219,40,"poverty targeting programs in Africa. For example, in Kenya and Zambia, pressure from"
219,41,"members of parliament was instrumental in expanding small-scale pilot initiatives (Pruce"
219,42,"and Hickey 2017).30"
219,43,"       Political shock related to subsidy reform may also change the prospects for building"
219,44,"a pro-UBI coalition in a developing country. The bulk of the political economy literature"

222,2,"on developing countries covers the experiences of subsidy reforms (see Inchauste and"
222,3,"Victor 2017). The political economy of the UBI is intricately linked to subsidy reform,"
222,4,"because removing subsidies is often considered a source for UBI financing. As Com-"
222,5,"mander (2012) notes, compensating large swathes of the population for losses incurred"
222,6,"in removing subsidies has become a doxology in policy advice for such reforms. Chap-"
222,7,"ter 1 describes the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with its almost universal cash"
222,8,"transfer to compensate for food and energy subsidy removal (see Tabatabai 2012 for an"
222,9,"in-depth political economy analysis of the Iranian case). Jordan has adopted compen-"
222,10,"sation schemes for 80 percent of its population while removing petroleum subsidies"
222,11,"(Atamanov, Jellema, and Serajuddin 2015). In all those cases, empirical analysis demon-"
222,12,"strates that the poor and middle class are better off after the reform."
222,13,"      However, compensatory mechanisms in subsidy reforms are very far from UBI"
222,14,"principles. Near-universal cash transfers used as a vehicle to overcome public opposition"
222,15,"to subsidy removal lack a genuine constituency to ensure sustainability. The architects of"
222,16,"subsidy reforms call for “temporary” compensations, intended to overcome transitional"
222,17,"effects in adjusting to the new relative prices. They do not carry the connotations of per-"
222,18,"manent new engagement between the state and citizens—and more often than not tend"
222,19,"to become extremely politicized and abandoned with changes in ruling coalitions. UBI"
222,20,"may thus become a topic for discussion, or even an element of the political discourse, in"
222,21,"the context of subsidy reform, but its sustainability is highly problematic."
222,22,"      Constituency around a novel idea of UBI can be built, even in the context of mid-"
222,23,"dle-income countries. But it is important to remember a fundamental purpose of such a"
222,24,"policy idea: it is a means, not a goal. It is crucial to assess whether the political process"
222,25,"that such constituencies will motivate will lead to implementation of a UBI that will be"
222,26,"conducive to poverty reduction and shared prosperity—or not."
222,27,"Political Transformations of the UBI"
222,28,"Over the long run, the success of a policy idea can be measured with several clear"
222,29,"parameters (Marsh and McConnell 2010). The most basic measure is a firmly legislated"
222,30,"UBI in the statute books. But legislative presence is a necessary but insufficient condition"
222,31,"for success. Three additional measures allow assessment of a new policy idea to have a"
222,32,"lasting impact: effectiveness, robustness, and resilience."
222,33,"      A new social program is effective when it achieves its stated objectives.31 In the"
222,34,"specific case of UBI, effectiveness also relates to the absence of negative effects, such"
222,35,"as a large-scale reduction in labor market participation, unsustainable fiscal burdens, an"
222,36,"increase in inflation, or pressure on minimum wage levels. The effectiveness of a UBI"
222,37,"can be assessed in various ways, including through a social experiment or pilots, or sim-"
222,38,"ulations and evidence reviews as done in this book.32"
222,39,"      Robustness and resilience are criteria that describe the political stability of a new"
222,40,"program over time (resilience),33 or the ability of a policy to deliver on its intended goals"
222,41,"under a variety of changing circumstances (robustness). Robustness is challenged by"

223,2,"  BOX 6.2 The Politics Surrounding the Introduction of Universal Child"
223,3,"  Allowances in the United Kingdom"
223,4,"  T   he policy process that led to the introduction of family allowances in the United"
223,5,"      Kingdom in 1945 is a good example of how a multiparty coalition with diverging"
223,6,"  interests can emerge to support a specific policy instrument. The initial idea came"
223,7,"  from a persistent campaign, begun with a pamphlet in 1911, by Eleanore Rathborne,"
223,8,"  a women’s and children’s rights political advocate. Evidence was building in sup-"
223,9,"  port of the claim that under current labor market conditions, families with many"
223,10,"  children remained in poverty. It also became clear that poverty traps were inher-"
223,11,"  ent in poverty benefits design: an unemployed worker receiving benefits would"
223,12,"  see a drop in family income by accepting minimum wages. It was also observed"
223,13,"  that tax child allowances were highly regressive, benefiting only the well-to-do"
223,14,"  paying taxes above the eligibility limit."
223,15,"  Several policy concerns converged after the end of World War II to increase sup-"
223,16,"  port for universal allowances: more women had become members of trade unions"
223,17,"  during the war years; there were concerns about falling fertility and the reduced"
223,18,"  health status of young men unfit for military service, reflecting poverty and poor"
223,19,"  nutrition; and finally there were concerns about inflation due to the abolishment of"
223,20,"  price and wage controls and a fear of spiraling prices. As advocated by John May-"
223,21,"  nard Keynes, family allowances were meant to act as a brake on excessive wage"
223,22,"  demands by trade unions."
223,23,"  By 1945, when William Beveridge advanced his policy proposal for the new wel-"
223,24,"  fare state, the motives for providing direct support to all families with children were"
223,25,"  recognized. The proposal prescribed universal child allowances paid to mothers in"
223,26,"  accordance with the number of children, and not dependent on means testing or"
223,27,"  work conditionalities."
223,28,"  Interestingly, political opposition to the proposal came from both Conservatives"
223,29,"  and trade unions, motivated by fundamentally the same concern: that paying the"
223,30,"  child allowances to mothers (as advocated by Rathborne) would shift the family"
223,31,"  power balance and undermine men’s dominance. Conservative opposition to"
223,32,"  family allowances was a factor in the party’s defeat in the 1945 elections, and the"
223,33,"  Family Allowances Act was soon passed by Parliament."
223,34,"  An interesting aspect of the process is that there was little debate about the objec-"
223,35,"  tives of the new transfers, a conscious decision on Rathborne’s part. This allowed"
223,36,"  the proposal to appeal to a broad swath of members of Parliament, as each could"
223,37,"  find something to like in the allowance (poverty relief, suppression of wage infla-"
223,38,"  tion, reduction of disincentives for work, or a simple desire to appeal to voters)."

224,2,"policy drift, the (deliberate) failure to update a particular policy in line with changing cir-"
224,3,"cumstances (Hacker 2004, 2005). The Islamic Republic of Iran’s subsidy reform program"
224,4,"from 2014 onward can be viewed as a type of policy drift, with the government having"
224,5,"continued energy price reform while refusing to increase the real value of compensatory"
224,6,"cash transfers accordingly (Salehi-Isfahani 2014). The Finnish experiment, which the"
224,7,"Sipilä government refused to expand and extend when it came to an end in December"
224,8,"2018, even before the results of its evaluation had been published, is another example"
224,9,"of a deliberate refusal to update.34"
224,10,"      Another process that challenges robustness is conversion, whereby an exist-"
224,11,"ing policy is redirected toward new goals or purposes to fit the interests of new actors"
224,12,"(Streeck and Thelen 2005). A UBI scheme initially aimed at addressing poverty can sub-"
224,13,"sequently be repurposed as a labor market activation policy simply by making sure that"
224,14,"the surrounding social support architecture retains a strict monitoring and employment"
224,15,"incentives regime.35"
224,16,"      Resilience refers to the ability of a policy to resist direct pressure for program"
224,17,"change, resulting either in its radical abolishment/replacement or in gradual changes that"
224,18,"significantly alter key characteristics of the policy.36 In 2010, in the first weeks of coming"
224,19,"to power, the newly elected British coalition government canceled the Child Trust Fund"
224,20,"scheme that paid out a stakeholder grant to each newborn U.K. national in a special sav-"
224,21,"ings account accessible upon reaching adulthood—despite the fact that this was viewed"
224,22,"as an important social achievement.37 More recently, in June 2018, the new provincial"
224,23,"government of Ontario suddenly decided to cancel the ongoing UBI trial, despite its"
224,24,"having indicated the contrary during the elections."
224,25,"      Another major concern is presented by the mechanism of layering—a process"
224,26,"whereby new rules are grafted onto an existing policy, leading to policy change over"
224,27,"time (Mahoney and Thelen 2010; Streeck and Thelen 2005). Postconflict countries offer"
224,28,"examples of how pro-poor programs once introduced are marginalized by pressures to"
224,29,"maintain and even expand entitlements for veterans and victims of war, depleting polit-"
224,30,"ical and fiscal oxygen for pro-poor transfers (see, e.g., World Bank 2008 on Bosnia and"
224,31,"Herzegovina). Another example of layering discussed in the literature is the complex"
224,32,"dynamics of competition between cash-based targeted social safety nets and an in-kind"
224,33,"rice distribution scheme in Indonesia (McCarthy and Sumarto 2018)."
224,34,"      Given the lack of political feasibility of introducing UBI in a policy big bang moment,"
224,35,"the proponents of this idea offer some variations to radical reform with three more"
224,36,"“feasible” trajectories. These, however, as we will show, face difficulties in leading to a"
224,37,"sustainable policy change."
224,38,"      The first trajectory is to institute a partial UBI at a low level and build up incre-"
224,39,"mentally toward a more generous UBI.38 Introducing a UBI at a low level minimizes the"
224,40,"financial burdens. Such a partial UBI is more likely to fit the institutional structure of"
224,41,"countries that have already put in place basic social protection schemes.39 This scenario"
224,42,"merely requires universalizing the most basic layer of social protection—retaining addi-"
224,43,"tional social policies not replaced by the UBI but in some cases reducing the payment in"
224,44,"proportion to the UBI (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2017)."
224,45,
225,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                201"
225,2,"       This pathway faces a number of risks. First, the complex layer of social protec-"
225,3,"tion schemes—some of which will be abolished entirely; others retained partially, but"
225,4,"with reduced payouts; still others kept unchanged after instituting a partial UBI—car-"
225,5,"ries the risk that some vulnerable individuals and households will lose out.40 This effect"
225,6,"would be exacerbated if the partial UBI replaces policies that serve a gateway function.41"
225,7,"Second, the interaction between a partial UBI and other support policies that remain"
225,8,"means tested or conditional is likely to hollow out many of the effects expected from"
225,9,"a UBI. Conditionality dominates unconditionality where individuals make use of other"
225,10,"forms of public support to supplement their partial UBI. This leads to a third problem: if"
225,11,"introducing a partial UBI does not produce the anticipated effects, or these do not mate-"
225,12,"rialize early enough, both the size and the stability of the relevant constituency—and,"
225,13,"subsequently, an enacting coalition—could be seriously undermined (see Groot 2004 for"
225,14,"a discussion of this point). Finally, even if a partial UBI at a low level is properly imple-"
225,15,"mented, ensuring that the level increases over time is far from automatic—particularly"
225,16,"once we take into account competition for social spending from other programs (Desai"
225,17,"and Kharas 2017)."
225,18,"       Gourevitch and Stanczyk (2018) have examined this challenge. Meaningful UBI"
225,19,"requires heavily redistributing wealth from those at the apex of the income distribution"
225,20,"toward the rest of society (requiring a dramatic increase in the incidence of taxes on the"
225,21,"rich, as discussed in chapter 4, which one can expect will be resisted at all costs). The"
225,22,"reality of politics in many countries suggests that the rich have disproportional influence"
225,23,"on the political process. Hence, the UBI promise is illusory. Calnitsky (2017) responds"
225,24,"to this rather pessimistic view by defending the achievability of UBI, passing from a"
225,25,"modest—but still emancipatory—program to a more ambitious one. He notes some pos-"
225,26,"itive political feedback effects that may sustain progress toward a more meaningful UBI."
225,27,"The debate continues, but so far both countries that have introduced some version of"
225,28,"UBI—the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia—have seen its real value collapse, rather"
225,29,"than increase, over time."
225,30,"       A second proposal envisages a cognate version of UBI that compromises on uncon-"
225,31,"ditionality by introducing a soft participation requirement.42 This pathway tries to"
225,32,"inoculate UBI from concerns about providing income support without any reciprocal"
225,33,"condition. The dynamics of this trajectory are to first identify a series of appropriate"
225,34,"activities that are broader than labor market participation or education but that still"
225,35,"elicit wide public support as a form of social participation.43 The aim of such a modifica-"
225,36,"tion is to overcome opposition to UBI, and foster consistency with many existing social"
225,37,"assistance programs built with an “activation” perspective. In a critical second step, the"
225,38,"proponents of this pathway maintain that bureaucratic hurdles related to the monitor-"
225,39,"ing of an expanding range of social activities in practice will rapidly be perceived as too"
225,40,"burdensome and costly, paving the way for moving toward a fully unconditional UBI (see"
225,41,"Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2017)."
225,42,"       This two-step path to a UBI through participation income is hard to implement polit-"
225,43,"ically. The first stage requires agreement on an operational set of criteria for determining"
225,44,"when an individual meets the social participation requirement, which is a nontrivial"

226,2,"challenge.44 Even if the first stage is implemented as planned, it remains uncertain"
226,3,"whether subsequent policy development involves relaxing conditions and embracing a"
226,4,"fully unconditional UBI—or instead reverting back to earlier conditions."
226,5,"       A third trajectory opts for implementing a UBI sequentially for different target"
226,6,"populations.45 This strategy proceeds with a number of easily identifiable steps, each"
226,7,"progressing toward more universal coverage by including new social groups. In a typical"
226,8,"scenario, the starting point would be by instituting a universal child benefit—or expand-"
226,9,"ing an existing child benefit scheme by abolishing any means testing—or, moving to the"
226,10,"other end of the life cycle, instituting a basic pension to be granted to all citizens upon"
226,11,"reaching retirement age. It is assumed that gradually the program will gain popularity"
226,12,"and be extended to other family members—for example, integrating students, the dis-"
226,13,"abled, the self-employed, and so on."
226,14,"       Again, several difficulties may arise. First, the assumption that distinct target popu-"
226,15,"lations can be neatly divided into discrete programs that can be transformed into a UBI"
226,16,"is not likely to hold across the whole population. Conversely, programs that cover distinct"
226,17,"target populations vary considerably—for example, in payment levels—which makes"
226,18,"it more difficult to turn each into a uniform UBI. Second, the problem with sequential"
226,19,"approaches is that they create significant path dependencies (see Pierson 2003, 2004)."
226,20,"From an economic perspective, pensioners would worry about a reduction of their ben-"
226,21,"efit when shared more widely, either by reducing the actual universal benefit or by"
226,22,"increased taxation. In addition, a deservingness norm is likely to block expanding the"
226,23,"benefit to less-deserving recipients. The sequential approach assumes a smooth transi-"
226,24,"tion from more- to less-deserving target populations, which is unrealistic and contradicts"
226,25,"actual experience in implementing such programs (e.g., child allowances).46"
226,26,"       A factor leading to the lack of resilience of UBI proposals is that many expressions"
226,27,"of political support for the UBI are “cheap”: they come with no real political commit-"
226,28,"ment, which means they are both easy to express and an unreliable indicator of current"
226,29,"or future willingness to expend political capital in support of UBI. A good example is"
226,30,"political actors endorsing UBI when in the opposition, only to fail to act on their earlier"
226,31,"endorsement once in government.47 A UBI coalition is highly instable when much of the"
226,32,"support for a UBI is cheap.48"
226,33,"       The option to pilot or experiment with UBI on a small scale offers a unique political"
226,34,"solution: it avoids the pitfalls of comprehensive policy commitment and allows engage-"
226,35,"ment with the idea while pushing the real decision further along the time horizon."
226,36,"Political agents conducting UBI experiments can claim credit for engaging with a policy"
226,37,"innovation while avoiding the risk of being held responsible for a policy fiasco.49 UBI"
226,38,"experiments also afford decision makers considerable leeway in terms of deciding how"
226,39,"much resources (time, finances, administrative support, and political capital) to commit"
226,40,"to such a venture: this partly explains the considerable variation in experimental design"
226,41,"across ongoing and planned pilots. Importantly, support for a UBI experiment does not"
226,42,"in any way imply commitment to instituting a UBI. In Namibia, years of experiment-"
226,43,"ing with a UBI—and even the presence of strong advocates in the government—have"
226,44,"not resulted in any action in its scale-up. In Finland, the government is already moving"
226,45,
227,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                203"
227,2,"toward implementing a new set of social security reforms, which changes the political"
227,3,"context within which the UBI experiment was conducted, with its first evaluation results"
227,4,"published in early 2019.50"
227,5,"       Small pilot schemes do not generate systematic opposition, because those opposed"
227,6,"do not think it is worthwhile to spend political resources; as soon as pilots are used to"
227,7,"change the policy agenda, that calculation changes and real opposition materializes. A"
227,8,"variant of this mechanism is found in the Swiss referendum; the initiative to vote on a"
227,9,"UBI proposal rapidly gained traction, while the actual referendum mobilized opposition"
227,10,"that did not exist before."
227,11,"       Support for UBI, as for many other popular ideas, displays a bandwagon effect (see"
227,12,"Nadeau, Cloutier, and Guay 1993). As media attention balloons, so does policy attention."
227,13,"And, as some local, regional, or national governments start taking UBI more seriously,"
227,14,"decision makers are pulled (and at times pushed) into taking a closer look and to either"
227,15,"emulate or at least learn from what is going on elsewhere (De Wispelaere 2016a)."
227,16,"       Opponents of UBI need not spend any political resources on resisting UBI proposals"
227,17,"until these have entered the policy or political process. UBI can be opposed largely because"
227,18,"of its association with a particular political party, organization, or platform. In this sce-"
227,19,"nario, toxic support from one faction prevents UBI from garnering support among factions"
227,20,"that might otherwise have considered supporting it. A good example of such a dynamic is"
227,21,"Finland. The traditional supporters of UBI—the Green League and the Left Alliance—were"
227,22,"both in opposition at the time when a ruling coalition initiated a UBI experiment and had"
227,23,"to criticize a proposal they had historically campaigned for (see box 6.1).51"
227,24,"Conclusions"
227,25,"This chapter has discussed the political economy of UBI. The combination of variation"
227,26,"in demand for a UBI and variation in capability to implement a UBI requires a detailed"
227,27,"analysis of the policy and institutional characteristics of a country before deciding on the"
227,28,"feasibility of specific UBI models."
227,29,"       The demand-capacity paradox—that is, a UBI is feasible where it is not really"
227,30,"demanded and needed; and where it is needed, it is not feasible—reminds us that where"
227,31,"a UBI is feasible and not demanded, there may be a good reason to not have a UBI at all."
227,32,"What matters is whether a basic income can positively influence the political dynamics"
227,33,"of redistribution and whether its introduction can lead to better social welfare outcomes."
227,34,"       This chapter points out that even if the answer is “yes,” politics introduce an addi-"
227,35,"tional layer of complexity that could make a welfare-enhancing UBI infeasible. Different"
227,36,"political constituencies can potentially support only one form of UBI, reducing common"
227,37,"support and the chances of implementing a fully fledged UBI in any setting. Only the"
227,38,"unemployed and those in precarious employment seem to emerge as the most stable"
227,39,"constituency for a UBI idea, and they represent a minority among voters. Across polit-"
227,40,"ical parties, left-wing programmatic ideology and ecological platforms support the UBI"
227,41,"idea. While left-wing and green parties are historically the driving force to push UBI on"
227,42,
228,1,"204                                                 Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
228,2,"the agenda, in the actual political process around UBI, the right-wing parties are the king"
228,3,"makers. As a result, we observe across different contexts and countries that UBI pro-"
228,4,"posals become conservative rather than revolutionary to appeal to the political center: a"
228,5,"modest level of support, links to the conditionalities and activation requirements of the"
228,6,"existing welfare state, citizenship requirements, and so on."
228,7,"      In today’s highly fragmented political context, UBI is poised to be increasingly used"
228,8,"for propagandist and political campaigns with little commitment, resulting in a prolifera-"
228,9,"tion of pilots and schemes presented as a UBI, but deviating from it in essence. Moreover,"
228,10,"when combined with weak capacity to implement redistributive policies where basic"
228,11,"public goods such as law and order, property rights, and public health are not being deliv-"
228,12,"ered, a UBI may not be advisable. The risk in such a setting is that a UBI would be used to"
228,13,"buy votes and fuel the politics of vote buying at the continued expense of public goods."
228,14,"      Then what is the reason for outsiders pushing for it? It would seem these reasons"
228,15,"should be communicated to citizens and political leaders alike, so political institutions in"
228,16,"the country can then debate the reasons and decide whether and how to use the means"
228,17,"of a UBI for their goals."
228,18,"      In countries that lack the capacity to provide their population with meaningful"
228,19,"social protection, the UBI idea can garner demand and be transformative, but its actual"
228,20,"emergence hinges on a unique circumstance and resource endowments that could help"
228,21,"build capacity while maintaining commitment. Having at their disposal political econ-"
228,22,"omy analysis tools that assess perceptions, constituencies, coalitions, and their dynamics"
228,23,"can help policy makers and policy analysts make more informed choices when such cir-"
228,24,"cumstances arise."
228,25,"      To assess the political feasibility of a UBI, policy advisers can consider the main"
228,26,"elements discussed in this chapter. First, it is essential to have a good assessment of the"
228,27,"economic consequences of various UBI proposals (including taxation) and their likely"
228,28,"effects on poverty and inequality. This analysis would reveal whether a UBI is a techni-"
228,29,"cally sound economic policy for a country—and if so, what is the rationale for it, and"
228,30,"what is the evidence. Second, it is important to know how well the public understands"
228,31,"the proposals, and what the attitude is toward various forms of UBI. Such opinion polls,"
228,32,"especially when overlaid with other political participation data, serve as an important"
228,33,"reality check. Finally, it is necessary to understand the ideologies of the main politi-"
228,34,"cal parties and groups and to collect as much information as possible on the primary"
228,35,"arguments for and against the UBI to use to motivate these stakeholders (through press"
228,36,"analysis or more systematic data analysis as presented in this chapter)."
228,37,"      Political institutions determine the extent to which any technically sound UBI"
228,38,"policy is adopted. The political economy problem of the UBI is the same as for any other"
228,39,"“reform”—to understand the obstacles that are causing political institutions to not allow"
228,40,"technically sound policies to be pursued, and based on this understanding, to provide"
228,41,"ideas to reform leaders on how to overcome these obstacles."
228,42,"      Even where UBI as a policy tool remains largely outside of feasible social action"
228,43,"in both developed and developing countries, its presence in the debate is likely to have"
228,44,"positive side effects, including in sharpening the focus on inclusion and leaving no one"
228,45,
229,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                        205"
229,2,"behind in existing social protection programs. Policy analysts need to be careful to pre-"
229,3,"vent proposals for cash transfers to occupy the debate space at the expense of building"
229,4,"the institutions needed for economies to grow."
229,5,"Notes"
229,6,"1.   Experiments in the Netherlands (several municipalities) and Spain (Barcelona) are ongoing,"
229,7,"     while a pilot in Ontario was suddenly canceled in July 2018. Meanwhile, preparations by local"
229,8,"     authorities in Edinburgh, Fife, Glasgow, and North Ayrshire, with the collaboration of the Scot-"
229,9,"     tish government, are quite advanced; and policy makers in several other countries, including"
229,10,"     Italy and Portugal, are exploring options. Private, nongovernmental agents have also initiated"
229,11,"     or are operating basic income experiments, such as GiveDirectly in Kenya or Ycombinator in"
229,12,"     California. Such nongovernmental pilot studies can feed into the policy process at a later stage,"
229,13,"     but are distinct from those initiated by or run in close collaboration with government agencies."
229,14,"2.   Examples include France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom among developed countries and"
229,15,"     India, Kazakhstan, Namibia, and Sri Lanka among middle-income countries."
229,16,"3.   Most models to date (e.g., Atkinson 1996; Van Parijs 1995) have combined a UBI with a flat"
229,17,"     tax, splitting the distribution in the middle and producing a comparable number of net win-"
229,18,"     ners and losers. Recent work described by Francese and Prady (2018) shows that under a"
229,19,"     progressive tax regime, all but the top three deciles are net winners in UBI scenarios simulated"
229,20,"     with data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Chap-"
229,21,"     ters 3 and 5 of this book present detailed discussions of financing options."
229,22,"4.   This approach is developed further by Khemani (2017), who uses a problem-driven approach"
229,23,"     to coalition building and implementation by pulling out three distinct strands of explanations"
229,24,"     of political constraints to undertaking reforms: (1) explanations centered around problems of"
229,25,"     credible commitment to a policy change by decision makers, (2) around problems of norms"
229,26,"     or beliefs, and (3) around preferences for public goods in the broad sense of determining"
229,27,"     public attitudes toward reform proposals."
229,28,"5.   See Bossuroy and Coudouel (2018) for a thorough review of the generally hostile political"
229,29,"     attitude of ruling parties in Africa to the idea of even targeted safety nets, let alone uncon-"
229,30,"     ditional universal grants. Caputo (2012) documents a history of debates around the UBI in"
229,31,"     Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and"
229,32,"     the United States. Among these countries, none has come close to a UBI as a serious policy"
229,33,"     proposal, but it has become part of the policy debate everywhere. In Mexico, basic income"
229,34,"     has taken on the form of a universal basic pension, which was successfully implemented; but"
229,35,"     expanding it to other groups is out of the question. Brazil has followed a similar path. Only"
229,36,"     in Finland and subnational entities such as Catalonia, Ontario, Quebec, and Scotland (at the"
229,37,"     local level) has a UBI entered the realm of real policy making. See Chrisp (2017) for more on"
229,38,"     left-right attitudes. For a recent study emphasizing how basic income produces political con-"
229,39,"     flict along class lines, see Gourevitch and Stanczyk (2018)."
229,40,"6.   In most cases, UBI is a tax and transfer policy: net recipients have an income below a thresh-"
229,41,"     old point such that their tax liability does not contribute to basic income, while those above"
229,42,"     this threshold contribute to funding the basic income scheme. In this scenario, the UBI is a"
229,43,"     redistributive scheme: even when all are recipients of a basic income, they are not all benefi-"
229,44,"     ciaries. See Van Parijs and Vanderborght (2017) for further discussion."
229,45,
230,1,"206                                                      Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
230,2,"7.  This is the case with the Finnish government in rolling out the first nationwide basic income"
230,3,"    experiment, where only one of three coalition partners favors basic income (De Wispelaere,"
230,4,"    Halmetoja, and Pulkka 2018; Stirton et al. 2017)."
230,5,"8.  The Finnish case is again illustrative: the two main advocates of basic income—the Green"
230,6,"    League and the Left Alliance—were in opposition (De Wispelaere, Halmetoja, and Pulkka"
230,7,"    2018; Stirton et al. 2017)."
230,8,"9.  It is worth noting that the level of the social dividend is constrained by the size of the sover-"
230,9,"    eign wealth fund and its performance. Note also that the share of a sovereign wealth fund paid"
230,10,"    out as a social dividend remains a political decision. The Alaska Permanent Fund, for instance,"
230,11,"    pays out most of its returns in the form of a (regressive) tax rebate and only a small part in the"
230,12,"    form of a universal dividend."

230,16,"12. See, for instance, Coelho (2018) on Hungary. As discussed in chapter 4, Kazakhstan and Russia"
230,17,"    are characterized both by the significant coverage of their social assistance schemes and their"
230,18,"    institutional complexity, reflecting higher-than-average capacity."
230,19,"13. See https://isp.hse.ru/en/announcements/227307109.html."
230,20,"14. Only in cases where the financing comes from windfall revenue (such as a natural resource"
230,21,"    rent) can the UBI be presented as a policy that benefits everyone."
230,22,"15. Source: Angus Reid Institute, http://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016.08.10_"
230,23,"    Basic_Income_PressReleaseTables.pdf. Note that the different surveys cited in this section"
230,24,"    adopt different definitions of basic income, including variable levels of detail which will affect"
230,25,"    the comparability of the results. Introducing less detail runs the risk that respondents fail to"
230,26,"    fully appreciate the distinctiveness of the basic income proposal (Pulkka 2018). But introduc-"
230,27,"    ing too many details primes respondents to focus on very specific models."
230,28,"16. Interestingly, with the exception of Finland, support for basic income in the Nordic countries"
230,29,"    is comparatively weak. The Finnish exception could be explained by the media attention"
230,30,"    associated with the basic income experiment. Another explanation is that in countries like"
230,31,"    Norway and Sweden, the existing welfare state functions well enough to depress any demand"
230,32,"    for basic income. Andersson and Kangas (2005), comparing basic income support in Finland"
230,33,"    versus Sweden, find support for this hypothesis; also see Lee (2018)."
230,34,"17. Vlandas (2018). Those receiving income from self-employment and farming reported com-"
230,35,"    paratively low levels of support, which is an interesting finding given that those two groups"
230,36,"    are often singled out as key beneficiaries in concrete proposals at both the national and Euro-"
230,37,"    pean Union–wide level. See, e.g., Van Parijs and Vanderborght (2017) on the EU dividend."
230,38,"18. See Vlandas (2018). A recent survey in Finland confirms this finding; the unemployed are the"
230,39,"    most supportive group, compared to those in full or part-time employment and those outside"
230,40,"    of the labor market (Pulkka 2018)."
230,41,"19. Recent unemployment is widely considered to have a scarring impact that affects future"
230,42,"    employment opportunities; see Gangl (2004, 2006)."
230,43,"20. Standing (2011) employs this term to indicate a very broad and heterogeneous social category,"
230,44,"    an “emerging class” in his parlance. Precarious employment is more narrowly defined."
230,45,
231,1,"Chapter 6. The Political Economy of Universal Basic Income                                         207"
231,2,"21. Vlandas (2018) argues that ESS variation in support for a basic income between regular and"
231,3,"    nonstandard employment is much less than expected from an insider/outsider theory per-"
231,4,"    spective. The large variation in nonstandard contracts across different countries, including"
231,5,"    access to benefits, likely underestimates important variation in levels of support among dif-"
231,6,"    ferent types of precarious workers. Country-level analysis offers important additional insight."
231,7,"    Pulkka (2018) finds variation between support for basic income between full-time (48 per-"
231,8,"    cent) and part-time (61 percent) employees."
231,9,"22. The primary concern regarding precarious employment is typically job tenure or job loss. The"
231,10,"    extent to which precarious workers worry about job loss can be captured as a function of the"
231,11,"    probability of losing one’s current job (job insecurity), one’s ability to find another job (labor"
231,12,"    market insecurity), and the availability of income support during an extended unemployment"
231,13,"    spell (income insecurity) (Anderson and Pontussen 2007). Precariousness in employment"
231,14,"    does not merely refer to uncertainty or instability of job tenure but also comprises a wide"
231,15,"    range of qualitative aspects, including wage rates, nature of tasks, opportunity to use and"
231,16,"    upgrade skills, or authority relations and employee participation. Taking this variety into"
231,17,"    account means we need to be careful about imputing similar interests in implementing a"
231,18,"    basic income policy for precarious workers who are, in effect, differently situated."
231,19,"23. The Matthew effect, a term coined by sociologist Robert K. Merton, alludes to the Gospel of"
231,20,"    Matthew quote, “For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance;"
231,21,"    but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.” In social policy, the Matthew"
231,22,"    effect refers to the phenomenon that the middle classes tend to be the main beneficiaries of"
231,23,"    social benefits and services, even if these are primarily targeted at the poor."
231,24,"24. Even when middle classes express support for basic income in survey polling, this support"
231,25,"    may fragment once design and implementation details are put in full view (De Wispelaere"
231,26,"    2016a); for a contrasting view, see Torry (2016) and Van Parijs and Vanderborght (2017)."
231,27,"25. For instance, Philippe Van Parijs insists on the superiority of a UBI over conventional means-"
231,28,"    tested welfare state programs, claiming that it will lead to the liberation of an individual from"
231,29,"    being forced to sell his or her labor power in the market to satisfy his or her most basic needs."
231,30,"26. As for instance happened among U.K. Tories as a response to public concerns with increased"
231,31,"    fracking (UBIE 2017), to appease the opposition and make it more acceptable for the con-"
231,32,"    cerned communities (as a form of sharing profits from shale gas exploitation). However, their"
231,33,"    member of Parliament and former minister Nick Boles condemned it as “dangerous non-"
231,34,"    sense” (Mortimer 2017)."
231,35,"27. We actually know very little about trade union views; research here is very much lacking and"
231,36,"    information is anecdotal at best."
231,37,"28. Benoît Hamon, the Socialist Party candidate for president in 2017, built his platform around"
231,38,"    basic income; however, it did not pass into the second round."
231,39,"29. This is demonstrated by the very opportunistic use of the term “UBI” by the ruling populist"
231,40,"    coalition in Italy to evoke a concept that is very different, i.e., a guaranteed minimum income."
231,41,"30. The UBI can positively influence all aspects of social policies and of a social protection pro-"
231,42,"    gram. An especially interesting case is that of Brazil, where in 2004, President Lula da Silva"
231,43,"    signed the UBI principle into law. Widely heralded by UBI advocates as a major victory, the"
231,44,"    law has, at least until now, achieved relatively little. Some researchers blame this on competi-"
231,45,"    tion for resources and political capital with the flagship conditional cash transfer Bolsa Família"
231,46,"    program, which was introduced at the same time. But there is a clear positive effect of UBI"
231,47,"    principles on the conditional cash transfer as it has became effective in Brazil. First, unlike in"
231,48,
232,1,"208                                                      Jurgen De Wispelaere and Ruslan Yemtsov"
232,2,"    most Latin American countries that strongly enforce the conditions of cash transfers, in Brazil"
232,3,"    the transfer includes an unconditional “guaranteed” part as an entitlement. The conditions"
232,4,"    do not trigger penalties or sanctions automatically, but failure to comply leads to increased"
232,5,"    attention from social workers and a search for remedial action; it takes years before benefits"
232,6,"    are affected (Fizsbein and Schady 2009). Second, the program has put a strong emphasis on"
232,7,"    inclusion, leading the government to launch the “Brazil without Misery” plan in 2011 which"
232,8,"    aimed to increase participation in and access to social programs by the extremely poor."
232,9,"31. Congruence between formal policy goals and street-level operational goals is a prerequisite for"
232,10,"    effective welfare administration (Meyers, Riccucci, and Lurie 2001)."
232,11,"32. Examples of such performance indicators—e.g., impact on poverty and inequality, cost-bene-"
232,12,"    fit ratio—are detailed in chapter 4 using illustrations from country simulations."
232,13,"33. See de Beus (2013) and De Wispelaere and Morales (2016). Stability is a key feature of any"
232,14,"    policy with long-term aspirations but is of specific interest to basic income, as the security of"
232,15,"    one’s future income stream is a critical feature of the intervention (Standing 2002)."
232,16,"34. De Wispelaere, Halmetoja, and Pulkka (2018) argue that the timing of the upcoming national"
232,17,"    election, weak support among Sipilä’s coalition partners, and the focus on basic income as a"
232,18,"    labor market activation instrument explain why expanding or extending the experiment was"
232,19,"    never really in the offing."
232,20,"35. An important complication in experimenting with basic income is that while the basic income"
232,21,"    itself is unconditional, many recipients require additional support that remains highly con-"
232,22,"    ditional. The combined effect in terms of incentives and behavior is very far from the ideal"
232,23,"    model of basic income."
232,24,"36. It is often argued that a basic income functions as a “third rail” in politics by virtue of being"
232,25,"    universal (Calnitsky 2016). The Alaska Permanent Fund seems to have weathered significant"
232,26,"    political pressure, attesting to its robustness as well as its resilience. This is largely due to the"
232,27,"    particular funding mechanism of a sovereign wealth fund (Bryan and Castillo 2012). More"
232,28,"    empirical research is required to understand other factors affecting a policy’s resilience."
232,29,"37. As a one-time basic capital grant, the U.K. Child Trust Fund scheme was not a strict basic"
232,30,"    income (paid out in regular installments), but shares with basic income a focus on individ-"
232,31,"    ual, universal, and unconditional eligibility. See LeGrand (2006) for discussion. Two political"
232,32,"    factors that are used to explain the lack of opposition and hence the ease with which the"
232,33,"    U.K. government could abolish the Child Trust Fund are the lack of universality—the scheme"
232,34,"    was rolled out cohort by cohort—and the fact that those currently in the scheme would only"
232,35,"    achieve their benefit upon reaching adulthood in the future. This lack of perceived benefits"
232,36,"    and strong interests in support of the policy made it less resilient."
232,37,"38. See Van Parijs and Vanderborght (2017). Simulations in chapter 4 use this as a starting point."
232,38,"39. One explanation for why the most likely basic income model in the Finnish context is pitched"
232,39,"    at €560 per month (the amount of the basic income experiment) is that it matches what"
232,40,"    unemployed Finns receive from basic unemployment security payments. See Halmetoja, De"
232,41,"    Wispelaere, and Perkiö (2018) for a discussion of the institutional fit of a partial basic income"
232,42,"    in Finland."
232,43,"40. See chapter 4 for a detailed analysis of winners and losers in several developing country con-"
232,44,"    texts. Also see Martinelli (2017) for a discussion of this problem based on microsimulations in"
232,45,"    the U.K. context."

233,2,"41. The evolution of single-gateway policy structures varies cross-nationally. See Clasen et al."
233,3,"    (2001)."
233,4,"42. Atkinson (1996) proposes a participation income."
233,5,"43. Prime examples include care work or volunteering (Hiilamo and Komp 2018); but see Zelleke"
233,6,"    (2018) for a critical reflection from a care perspective."
233,7,"44. See De Wispelaere and Stirton (2007) for a discussion of the implementation challenges of"
233,8,"    participation income."
233,9,"45. See Frankel and Mulvale (2014) for a discussion of this strategy in Manitoba."
233,10,"46. For example, Spain had a universal birth grant, cheque bebé, which was introduced in 2007"
233,11,"    and discontinued in 2010 amidst the austerity measures intended to stabilize public finances."
233,12,"    Discontinuing the policies, the government argued that a significant portion of the public was"
233,13,"    against the universal character of the grant, which was providing a sum of €2,500 even to bet-"
233,14,"    ter-off families that did not need it."
233,15,"47. De Wispelaere (2016b) discusses the example of the Green Party in Ireland, which was a long-"
233,16,"    time supporter but never brought up basic income once in its terms as part of the coalition"
233,17,"    government during the 30th Dáil Éireann (2007–11)."
233,18,"48. See Steensland (2006) for a detailed analysis of the difficulties in obtaining a robust political"
233,19,"    coalition around a guaranteed income in the 1970s in the United States."
233,20,"49. See Van Parijs and Vanderborght (2017) for a skeptical view of basic income experiments."
233,21,"50. Kalliomaa-Puha, Tuovinen, and Kangas (2016) and Kangas, Simanainen, and Honkanen"
233,22,"    (2017) illustrate some of the hurdles faced by the Finnish basic income experiment. De Wis-"
233,23,"    pelaere, Halmetoja, and Pulkka (2018) discuss the political nature of experimental design"
233,24,"    choices in the Finnish context."
233,25,"51. The experimental design was based on models advocated by the Green League and the Left"
233,26,"    Alliance, but nevertheless both offered harsh criticism to the experiment as proposed by the"
233,27,"    Sipilä government (De Wispelaere, Halmetoja, and Pulkka 2018). See De Wispelaere (2016a)"

241,6,"       his chapter explores the practical administrative steps needed to successfully"
241,7,"       implement a universal basic income (UBI) scheme. A UBI is distinct from a typical"
241,8,"       social protection program, because of both its universal nature and its provision of"
241,9,"       payments as a right, rather than as a discretionary benefit. In practice, however, a"
241,10,"UBI is still a variant of a social protection scheme, and its implementation would require"
241,11,"many of the same systems as in a standard social protection delivery chain. This chap-"
241,12,"ter discusses each phase of the delivery chain in keeping with the framework described"
241,13,"by Lindert, George, and Rodriguez-Caillava (forthcoming), showing how for a UBI some"
241,14,"steps are simpler and some more demanding (figure 7.1). The chapter also considers"
241,15,"key foundational elements of the surrounding ecosystem for a social protection agency’s"
241,16,"successful operation of a UBI—namely, identification (ID) systems, civil registration sys-"
241,17,"tems, interoperability and data protection frameworks, and payment service provision."

242,22,"and registration. In countries with advanced tax systems or large social registries for"
242,23,"existing social programs, the government may already have ID and payment informa-"
242,24,"tion for much of the population. Typically, this information will be registered at the"
242,25,"household level, meaning that data will still need to be converted to or newly collected"
242,26,"at the individual level. Some existing registries may already include entries and payment"
242,27,"information for all or almost all individuals within a certain age category. For example,"
242,28,"old-age social pensions have proliferated in the past two decades, now covering on aver-"
242,29,"age more than half of the population over age 60 in the Sub-Saharan African region and"
242,30,"offering universal old-age coverage in countries such as Bolivia, Mauritius, and Namibia"
242,31,"(World Bank 2018b). Notwithstanding, in most low- and middle-income countries, the"
242,32,"majority of the population is not yet covered by tax databases and social registries,"
242,33,"necessitating a substantial outreach and registration effort to build a populationwide reg-"
242,34,"istry of individuals and their payment information."
242,35,"Outreach"
242,36,"A UBI outreach campaign would need to be wide reaching, using a range of communi-"
242,37,"cation strategies to inform the entire population about its right to a basic income, the"
242,38,"plan for implementation, and instructions for registration. As for all social assistance"
242,39,"programs, outreach will need to be rigorous in reaching the hard to serve. The poor-"
242,40,"est and most in need typically live in more remote areas, have less access to means of"
242,41,"communication, are more likely to be illiterate, may not speak the official language of"
242,42,"the country, and may have little trust in government, among other challenges. As dis-"
242,43,"cussed in chapter 1, this outreach is important even for universal programs. If the UBI is"
242,44,"being introduced as a substitute for any existing programs, special care must be taken"
242,45,"to ensure that past program beneficiaries are informed about and supported through"
242,46,"the transition. Aside from these concerns, the message of a UBI information campaign"
242,47,
243,1,"Chapter 7. What Does It Take to Deliver a Universal Basic Income in Practice?                 219"
243,2,"should be relatively simple compared to the intensive and repeated outreach needed to"
243,3,"explain targeted programs with complex assessments and intricate eligibility criteria."
243,4,"Intake and Registration"
243,5,"The UBI database would need to cover the entire population but would require much less"
243,6,"information about each registrant than targeted schemes, which often use detailed socio-"
243,7,"economic data to determine eligibility, customize benefit levels, and/or offer allied services."
243,8,"The system would only need to register each individual once, and no continuous updates"
243,9,"to reassess eligibility based on socioeconomic and household changes would be needed."
243,10,"Limited updates would need to be made over time, however, both in maintaining the roster"

243,14,"mentation might therefore involve a major push for a couple of years to register the entire"
243,15,"population, and then move to a less intensive stage of ongoing maintenance."
243,16,"       The social registry is the main system for collecting and processing registrant infor-"

244,5,"systems, such as the ID system, the civil registry, or immigration or citizenship systems."
244,6,"        Some countries may choose to develop a UBI registry by building on the infor-"
244,7,"mation and registration processes already used for existing social registries, which are"
244,8,"present in at least 60 low- and middle-income countries (Socialprotection.org 2017)."
244,9,"The information in a few of these registries is already quite expansive, covering a vast"
244,10,"majority of households (figure 7.2). For example, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Paki-"
244,11,"stan, and the Philippines all have large social registries covering 75 percent or more of"
244,12,"their population (Leite et al. 2017). In many other countries, social registry coverage is at"
244,13,"50 percent or less of the population. Countries in the early stage of developing a social"
244,14,"registry, such as Sierra Leone and Mali, cover less than 5 percent of the population,"
244,15,"demanding enormous efforts to expand the registry for UBI implementation."
244,16,"        While building on existing registries may be the preferred approach in some con-"

245,3,"the country’s adults and a growing number of children), and forms the basis for social pro-"
245,4,"gram delivery (OECD 2018)."
245,5,"Assessment of Needs and Conditions"
245,6,"In the standard social protection delivery chain, the registration stage is followed by an"
245,7,"assessment process, which determines registrants’ eligibility for the program based on"
245,8,"the information collected. The assessment step will be far less demanding for a UBI than"
245,9,"for targeted schemes, consisting only of a simple, automated screening based on any"
245,10,"exclusionary criteria the UBI policy has set (e.g., screening out children or noncitizens)."
245,11,"       The elimination of complex targeting procedures has been one of the most common"
245,12,"arguments made in favor of the UBI, with advocates often forecasting large administrative"
245,13,"savings from cutting assessments of needs and conditions (e.g., Jhabvala and Standing"
245,14,"2010; Kidd 2016). While some savings will certainly be realized, because the program will"
245,15,"cover so many more people, it is not clear that these will be sufficient for a UBI’s total"
245,16,"administrative costs to be lower than those for targeted programs. There is limited recent"
245,17,"literature estimating the administrative costs of targeting (Devereux et al. 2017), but ear-"
245,18,"lier estimates suggest costs of around 0.6–9.0 percent of total program costs (Baulch"
245,19,"2002; Grosh et al. 2008), or 3–8 percent of the value of transfers (Van der Berg, Siebrits,"
245,20,"and Lekezwa 2010). While low relative to overall program costs, targeting procedures can"
245,21,"account for up to about 75 percent of administrative costs (Grosh et al. 2008), though they"
245,22,"can also be as low as 18 percent (Tesliuc et al. 2014). This large range indicates that the"
245,23,"actual costs of targeting—and therefore the potential savings from its elimination—vary"
245,24,"greatly depending on the particular targeting approach, program, and delivery context."
245,25,"Phase 2: Decision Making"
245,26,"The second phase in the social protection delivery chain consists of decision making"
245,27,"about enrollment and benefit levels, both of which are straightforward processes for"
245,28,"a UBI. As a universal program, there is no discretion to select the most in need from"
245,29,"among eligible registrants, as sometimes happens based on budget availability in tar-"
245,30,"geted schemes. Furthermore, there is little to no variation in benefit levels among scheme"
245,31,"recipients, with the only potential difference being a lower benefit value for children rel-"
245,32,"ative to adults, or slight geographic adjustments based on the cost of living in different"
245,33,"areas (De Wispelaere and Stirton 2004)."
245,34,"Phase 3: Implementation"
245,35,"Payments"
245,36,"A UBI would generally follow the same payment administration and provision processes"
245,37,"as any other cash transfer, with the only major differences being the larger number"
245,38,"of claimants and the use of the individual as the assistance unit with UBI (versus the"
245,39,
246,1,"222                              Christina Lowe, Margaret Grosh, Tina George, and Ugo Gentilini"
246,2,"household unit as used for many other cash transfers). Both of these factors dramati-"
246,3,"cally expand the number of payments administered, increasing the appeal of a digital"
246,4,"payment system (in which money is transferred electronically into recipients’ financial"
246,5,"institution or mobile money account, rather than manually distributed in cash or check"
246,6,"form at local payment points). Government capacity for e-payments, as well as the state"
246,7,"of the payments infrastructure (detailed later in this chapter), is currently inadequate"
246,8,"for a UBI in most low- and middle-income countries. Thus, countries interested in a UBI"
246,9,"might first improve payment structures before rolling out a UBI and/or rely on a mix of"
246,10,"manual and digital methods to deliver a UBI scheme."
246,11,"       Currently, 74 percent of people receiving government payments in upper-mid-"
246,12,"dle-income countries are paid electronically via a financial institution or mobile account;"
246,13,"15 percent receive payments in cash and 12 percent through some other method such as"
246,14,"checks or vouchers (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). In lower-middle-income countries also,"
246,15,"digital payments are the norm, with just over half (55 percent) of people receiving gov-"
246,16,"ernment payments into an account, compared to 27 percent in cash and 18 percent by"
246,17,"another method. But in low-income countries, cash continues to be the most common"
246,18,"method for government payments (reported by 43 percent of recipients), although digi-"
246,19,"tal payments made into an account follows closely behind (39 percent)."
246,20,"       Shifting from a manual to a digital system for government payments can offer"
246,21,"many advantages, including potential increases in cost efficiency and reductions in leak-"
246,22,"ages. In Brazil, switching from a manual to a digital payment system issued by the"
246,23,"state-owned bank helped cut administrative costs from 15 percent to 3 percent of the"
246,24,"disbursed benefit (Lindert et al. 2007); the leakage of pension payment funds in a trial"
246,25,"in Andhra Pradesh, India, dropped by 47 percent when payments were made via bio-"
246,26,"metric smart cards rather than cash handouts (Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar"
246,27,"2016). Switching from manual to electronic payments can also bring important benefits"
246,28,"to recipients, such as improved financial inclusion and program accessibility. For exam-"
246,29,"ple, in Thailand, 14 percent of adults with a bank or mobile money account opened their"
246,30,"first account to receive a government transfer (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). In Niger,"
246,31,"beneficiaries of a social assistance program saved approximately 3.5 hours of travel and"
246,32,"wait time per mobile money transfer, relative to the manual cash equivalent (Aker et al."
246,33,"2016). Because of their lower marginal cost (for both government and recipients) and"
246,34,"greater flexibility, digital payments can be paid more frequently and more easily stag-"
246,35,"gered over the month, reducing security risks and supporting markets to better cope"
246,36,"with potential surges in demand following disbursements."
246,37,"       While digital payment systems offer significant benefits, they also bring challenges."
246,38,"They typically take much longer to set up—at least 12–18 months, compared to only"
246,39,"3–12 months for a manual payment system (ISPA 2016). They require reliable physical"
246,40,"infrastructure and can easily be undermined by electricity or mobile network outages."
246,41,"Nationwide financial infrastructure is also needed, but banks often do not find it cost-ef-"
246,42,"fective to extend services across the population, prompting risks of financial exclusion."
246,43,"Lower levels of literacy, numeracy, and technology access further heighten exclusion"
246,44,"risks among disadvantaged groups. Depending on the partnership arrangement reached,"
246,45,
247,1,"Chapter 7. What Does It Take to Deliver a Universal Basic Income in Practice?           223"
247,2,"bank fees for service provision can make e-payment mechanisms less cost-effective for"
247,3,"the government and/or the recipient."
247,4,"       Within digital payment systems, government transfers into a unique, preauthen-"
247,5,"ticated bank account are considered the gold standard, but require substantial upfront"
247,6,"investment. One of the historical challenges has been that Know Your Customer (KYC)"
247,7,"banking regulations require authentication of a person’s identity before a bank account"
247,8,"can be opened, and many people in developing countries have lacked official ID docu-"
247,9,"mentation. Yet the case of India demonstrates that these challenges can be overcome."
247,10,"As part of a push to increase banking access across the population, a rapid electronic"
247,11,"authentication process was used, enabling ID to be verified and KYC requirements to be"
247,12,"met anywhere with mobile phone connectivity in a matter of minutes. Through this ini-"
247,13,"tiative, India increased the share of adults with a bank account from 35 percent in 2011"
247,14,"to 80 percent in 2017 (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018)."
247,15,"       A less common digital option for government payments is mobile money pay-"
247,16,"ment delivery. Of the 60 million unbanked adults worldwide who receive government"
247,17,"transfers in cash, two-thirds have a mobile phone (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). Mobile"
247,18,"phone ownership, however, is not sufficient to enable successful government payments"
247,19,"through this mechanism. An appropriate regulatory environment must be developed,"
247,20,"since existing banking regulations typically do not cover mobile money providers (ISPA"
247,21,"2016). Nationwide network connectivity and mobile data coverage are needed, along"
247,22,"with a reliable electricity supply to power mobile phones, cell towers, and payment pro-"
247,23,"vider operating systems. Even Kenya, a leader in mobile money infrastructure, could not"
247,24,"make a mobile money–based solution for a social assistance scheme work from 2010 to"
247,25,"2012 due to network connectivity issues (Zimmerman, Bohling, and Parker 2014). The"
247,26,"program administrators instead opted to transfer payments into accounts with debit"
247,27,"cards issued by a financial institution."
247,28,"Monitoring"
247,29,"As an unconditional entitlement, a UBI would not need to monitor recipients’ compli-"
247,30,"ance with any of the conditions stipulated by conditional cash transfer or job search/"
247,31,"labor activation schemes. However, monitoring systems would still be required to ensure"
247,32,"that complete and on-time payments were made to all intended recipients and not paid"
247,33,"to any duplicate, fraudulent, or deceased recipients."
247,34,"       Ceasing payments upon death may actually be a fairly challenging task, if an indi-"
247,35,"vidual is only required to register once for a UBI program, and payments are thereafter"
247,36,"transferred digitally into their account. Ideally, the UBI registry would be linked to an"
247,37,"up-to-date death register in the civil registration system, automatically flagging deceased"
247,38,"recipients in the UBI system. But, as discussed below, many countries have extremely"
247,39,"limited civil registration systems and deaths routinely go unrecorded. Other approaches"
247,40,"would therefore be needed to identify deceased beneficiaries. Where biometric authenti-"
247,41,"cation is required for payments, proof of life would automatically be provided each time"
247,42,"a person accesses his or her account. A more burdensome alternative would be to rely"
247,43,
248,1,"224                             Christina Lowe, Margaret Grosh, Tina George, and Ugo Gentilini"
248,2,"on periodic in-person recertification for continued participation in the UBI scheme. The"
248,3,"required frequency of this recertification might be greater for those above a certain age—"
248,4,"for example, UBI recipients under 65 years of age might be asked to present themselves"
248,5,"in person every five years, while those over 65 might have to do so every three years, and"
248,6,"those over 75 annually. As in all social protection programs, recertification requirements"
248,7,"present important trade-offs. Tighter demands may reduce the risk of leakage, but they"
248,8,"also heighten the potential for exclusion errors and increase the administrative burden."
248,9,"       Another important function of the monitoring system would be to address any"
248,10,"issues, complaints, or appeals. Programs with simpler eligibility requirements generally"
248,11,"have lower rates of errors, fraud, and corruption (van Stolk and Tesliuc 2010), suggesting"
248,12,"that a UBI scheme would have a fairly small proportion of grievances in relative terms."
248,13,"On the other hand, given its universal scope and permanent duration, a UBI program"
248,14,"will still have significant numbers of complaints in absolute terms, requiring a solid"
248,15,"grievance redress mechanism. This mechanism could build on existing social protection"
248,16,"grievance redress systems, which are in place in many countries but have historically"
248,17,"been underused and/or underperforming, due to both demand- and supply-side prob-"
248,18,"lems (Barca, Notosusanto, and Emmett 2012). International best practice recommends"
248,19,"that there be multiple channels for resolving complaints, including independent chan-"
248,20,"nels such as ombudsmen, audit institutions, or third-party complaint handlers (Barca"
248,21,"2016). To reduce costs and improve accessibility for citizens, there should be grievance"
248,22,"redress mechanisms at the point of service delivery, where information and transaction"
248,23,"costs are lowest."
248,24,"Surrounding Ecosystem: Foundational"
248,25,"Elements"
248,26,"Besides the systems created and managed directly by the relevant social protection"
248,27,"agency, several additional systems should be in place to create the enabling architecture"
248,28,"for UBI delivery. To accurately register and pay recipients, each individual must be iden-"
248,29,"tifiable in a credible manner, requiring a strong ID system. Ideally, this should go hand"
248,30,"in hand with a robust civil registration system to ensure that continuous changes in the"
248,31,"population (e.g., births and deaths) are recorded. These ID systems need to communi-"
248,32,"cate with multiple other administrative systems (such as the UBI registry and payrolls),"
248,33,"meaning that well-considered interoperability and data protection frameworks are also"
248,34,"needed. In addition, the provision of payment services must be sufficiently developed"
248,35,"so the government can make a substantial proportion of UBI payments electronically."
248,36,"ID Systems"
248,37,"Identification is the process of ensuring that an individual has a unique identifier estab-"
248,38,"lishing who he or she is (Leite et al. 2017), thus enabling verification of a registrant’s or"
248,39,"recipient’s identity, ensuring nonduplication, and linking the social registry with other"
248,40,
249,1,"Chapter 7. What Does It Take to Deliver a Universal Basic Income in Practice?             225"
249,2,"administrative information systems (such as the tax or civil registration system). The"
249,3,"unique identifier can take the form a foundational ID (a unique government-recognized"
249,4,"ID credential) or a functional ID (assigned to the individual by a government agency for"
249,5,"a specific transaction or service, such as a voter card, health or insurance records, or a"
249,6,"driver’s license). While in past decades, ID systems often existed in manual, paper-based"
249,7,"forms, countries today are increasingly relying on digital technologies in their ID systems."
249,8,"       Modern ID systems use digital technologies to enable more efficient and transpar-"
249,9,"ent administration and service delivery, increased security, reduced fraud and payment"
249,10,"leakages, more accurate statistics for planning purposes, and greater capacity to respond"
249,11,"to disasters and epidemics (World Bank 2017). But digital ID platforms also pose a"
249,12,"number of risks and challenges, including inadvertent exclusion of hard-to-reach popu-"
249,13,"lations, onerous mandates that deter individuals from accessing services, and increased"
249,14,"rent-seeking involving registration or certificates (World Bank 2016). In the worst case,"
249,15,"identifying information may be used for nefarious purposes, such as to track or discrim-"
249,16,"inate against marginalized groups. There are thus serious legal and regulatory concerns"
249,17,"about the types, extent, and use of information collected. Ensuring trusted data exchange"
249,18,"and data security is a major technological challenge, as is the extension of digital access"
249,19,"to remote areas. Government procurement of digital platforms for ID systems can also"
249,20,"be challenging, since technology solutions are often tied to specific vendors."
249,21,"       A UBI requires a government to be able to find and pay each member of the pop-"
249,22,"ulation; this is clearly far easier when the government has a single, accurate population"
249,23,"database and a means of quickly and credibly verifying each person’s identity. Provided"
249,24,"that the above risks are appropriately managed, a foundational ID system using digital"
249,25,"technologies could provide an optimal ID ecosystem for UBI implementation. Yet this"
249,26,"configuration is out of reach for many countries at present. Where digital technologies"
249,27,"are less advanced, a government may need to rely on certain manual elements for issu-"
249,28,"ing or authenticating a person’s identity. And where a foundational ID system has yet"
249,29,"to be created, a government may instead expand upon existing functional ID databases"
249,30,"(e.g., electoral rolls or earlier social programs’ registries) to find and verify payments to"
249,31,"individuals (Atick et al. 2014)."
249,32,"       Globally, around 1 billion people lack access to a government-recognized ID.1"
249,33,"Half (50 percent) of these people live in Sub-Saharan Africa, and approximately one-"

251,2,"        Marginalized groups are particularly likely to lack access to ID systems. Data on"
251,3," 99 countries show a large gender gap in the unidentified population in low-income coun-"
251,4," tries, with over 45 percent of women lacking a national ID compared to 30 percent of"
251,5," men (World Bank 2018a). In the same low-income countries, nearly half (45 percent) of"
251,6," those in the poorest income quintile lack a national ID, whereas only a quarter (28 per-"
251,7," cent) of those in the richest quintile lack official ID."
251,8,"        Reaching these marginalized groups often requires significantly more resources"
251,9," than the average cost of ID provision (Palacios 2014). For example, Peru increased"
251,10," national ID coverage to around 95 percent with special outreach campaigns. While the"
251,11," standard cost of this was US$10, the cost was double (US$22) in the coastal region, qua-"
251,12," druple (US$42) in the mountains, and twice over again (US$80) in the jungle."
251,13,"        The feasibility of bringing large numbers of unregistered people into the ID system"
251,14," is continually increasing, thanks to improvements in the mobility and affordability of"
251,15," digital technologies. In recent decades, many countries have either shifted from paper-"
251,16," based to electronic ID systems, or leapfrogged the paper-based stage altogether to build"
251,17," new national ID systems from scratch using digital technologies (World Bank 2016). Cur-"
251,18," rently, 161 countries have ID systems based on digital technologies.2 This includes more"
251,19," than three-quarters of developing countries (World Bank 2016), with almost every coun-"
251,20," try in Africa and Asia having either introduced an e-ID or intending to do so in the near"
251,21," future. Figure 7.4 shows the rapid growth in national and digital ID systems in Sub-Saha-"
251,22," ran Africa over the last decade."
251,23,"        Digital technologies are useful for many aspects of the ID process (World Bank"
251,24," 2017), including registration, issuance of credentials, and authentication of IDs:"
251,25,"                          •• For registration, many countries are now collecting biometric data (such as finger-"
251,26,"                             prints, iris, face scan) alongside traditional biographic data (name, date of birth,"
251,27,"                             gender, etc.). The biometric data greatly facilitate the process of de-duplication,"

252,2,"          particularly in countries without reliable civil registration documents to verify"
252,3,"          the uniqueness of biographic information."
252,4,"      •• For the issuance of ID credentials, countries are moving beyond purely paper-based"
252,5,"          IDs to provide digital ID cards (e.g., cards with bar codes or more advanced chip-"
252,6,"          based smart cards), mobile IDs (e.g., SIM cards with digital ID certificates), or"
252,7,"          entirely virtual IDs (e.g., India’s Aadhaar program does not provide any physical cre-"
252,8,"          dentials; instead, each person’s biometric ID is stored on a server). As of early 2017,"
252,9,"          82 percent of all countries issuing official ID cards have implemented programs that"
252,10,"          use smart cards or plastic cards and biometrics (Acuity Market Intelligence 2017)."
252,11,"      •• For authentication of IDs, various digital technologies are also growing in cover-"
252,12,"          age, including biometric readers, personal identification number (PIN) codes,"
252,13,"          digital signatures, and smartphone applications. Experts expect to see as many"
252,14,"          as 600 million devices with biometric authentication by 2021 (Smith 2016)."
252,15,"      By far the most famous country example of a newly developed digital ID system is"
252,16,"India, which has dominated the headlines for its ambitious Aadhaar program. Through"
252,17,"this initiative, more than 1 billion Indians have been biometrically enrolled in just six"
252,18,"years. India achieved this mass identification at an extremely low cost, spending US$1.16"
252,19,"per person for enrollment and registration (Atick 2014)."
252,20,"      The India example is at the very lowest end of what a foundational ID system is"
252,21,"typically expected to cost per capita. One estimate puts the average cost of enrollment"
252,22,"and registration for a foundational ID system at approximately US$3–US$6 per person,"
252,23,"plus an additional 15–25 percent per year for maintenance, software, and data updat-"
252,24,"ing (Atick 2014). Card production and distribution—which was not part of the cardless"
252,25,"Aadhaar initiative—may cost an additional US$1–US$5 per person (and an additional"
252,26,"US$0.50 for digital certificates), plus US$0.05–US$0.10 per card per year for mainte-"
252,27,"nance."
252,28,"Civil Registration Systems"
252,29,"Even as countries make major advances with their ID systems, an important role"
252,30,"remains for civil registration systems—the official systems for the universal, continu-"
252,31,"ous, permanent, and compulsory recording of vital events, such as births and deaths"
252,32,"(UN 1998). For example, countries with the most sophisticated biometric ID systems still"
252,33,"benefit from a strong civil registration system because it records biographic information"
252,34,"at birth, whereas most biometric data cannot be collected from newborn infants. Civil"
252,35,"registration systems thus establish a legal identity at birth and provide the initial basis"
252,36,"for enrollment in a foundational ID system."
252,37,"      Civil registration coverage in many countries is very limited (figure 7.5). Globally,"
252,38,"the births of around one-quarter of children under the age of five have never been record-"
252,39,"ed.3 Birth registration rates are especially low in Sub-Saharan Africa (43 percent) and"
252,40,"South Asia (60 percent), with Ethiopia’s and Somalia’s rates dipping as low as 3 percent."

253,15,"Death registration is even more limited, with 81 countries collecting data of very low"

253,17,"of lower-middle-income countries.4"
253,18,"Interoperability and Data Protection Frameworks"
253,19,"Some social assistance programs need extensive interoperability with other systems."
253,20,"This might be the case, for example, to check beneficiary eligibility against databases"
253,21,"with socioeconomic information, and to verify conditionality adherence against health"
253,22,"or schooling records. As a universal and unconditional scheme, a UBI draws on far"
253,23,"fewer systems, perhaps limited to the ID, civil registration, and social registry systems"
253,24,"described in this chapter. Yet even between these systems, there will be a need for"
253,25,"interoperability frameworks and a unique ID or alternative identifier to link correspond-"
253,26,"ing entries across databases."
253,27,"       Given the vast number of identifiable files in a UBI database, strong data protection"
253,28,"frameworks adhering to international data transfer and information privacy protocols"
253,29,"are critical.5 According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,"
253,30,"only 58 percent of countries globally have data protection laws in place. A further 10 per-"
253,31,"cent have legislation in draft form, and 21 percent of countries have no data protection"
253,32,"legislation at all.6"
253,33,"       A data protection framework should also include a number of practical elements,"
253,34,"including memorandums of understanding and data sharing protocols, strong access"
253,35,"restrictions for different levels of staff, and network security (Leite 2018). Arrange-"
253,36,"ments for database storage vary, with some social programs storing their own data, and"
253,37,"others outsourcing the security and hosting of databases to a third party (Barca 2017)."
253,38,"For example, the servers for Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net Programme are physically and"
253,39,"logically secured at the program level; Pakistan’s Benazir Income Support Programme"
253,40,

254,2,"database is hosted by the National Database and Registration Authority; and South Afri-"
254,3,"ca’s integrated beneficiary operations management system, SOCPEN, is hosted by the"
254,4,"South African State Information Technology Agency."
254,5,"Payment Service Provision"
254,6,"Another foundational element is the availability and uptake of banking or mobile money"
254,7,"services; this strongly determines the feasibility of regular government payments to the"
254,8,"entire population."
254,9,"       Recent years have seen significant improvements in the global availability and"
254,10,"uptake of banking and mobile money services, with 1.2 billion people having gained"
254,11,"access to some form of financial account since 2011 (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). Accord-"
254,12,"ing to Global Findex, the world’s most comprehensive database on financial inclusion,"
254,13,"69 percent of adults worldwide now have an account with a financial institution (a bank,"
254,14,"credit union, or cooperative or microfinance institution) or a mobile money provider"
254,15,"(Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). In high-income countries, account access is nearly univer-"
254,16,"sal, at 94 percent, and in upper-middle-income countries the rate is now 73 percent."
254,17,"However, account ownership is still only 58 percent in lower-middle-income countries,"
254,18,"and 35 percent in low-income countries."
254,19,"       The vast majority of account owners (98 percent globally) have an account at a"
254,20,"financial institution (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). Mobile money is far less widely used"
254,21,"(6 percent of account owners globally), although it is growing in availability and is now"
254,22,"present in 90 countries—including three-quarters of low- and lower-middle-income"
254,23,"countries (GSMA 2017). The global number of mobile money accounts increased by"
254,24,"25 percent in 2017 relative to the previous year, primarily driven by fast growth in Africa"
254,25,"and Asia. There are now 12 countries (all in Sub-Saharan Africa) where more people have"
254,26,"accounts with mobile money providers than with a financial institution (Demirgüç-Kunt"
254,27,"et al. 2018). But these countries remain the exception; in about half (52 percent) of all"
254,28,"countries, less than 5 percent of account owners have mobile money accounts or no data"
254,29,"are available."
254,30,"       As figure 7.6 shows, there is substantial deviation across and within regions in"
254,31,"account ownership rates (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). As a region, Sub-Saharan Africa"
254,32,"has the lowest level at 43 percent, followed by the Middle East and North Africa (48 per-"
254,33,"cent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54 percent). Within these regions, countries"
254,34,"exhibit great variation. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 80 percent of the"
254,35,"population in Kenya and Mauritius has an account, compared to less than 20 percent"
254,36,"of the population in the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Niger, and South Sudan."
254,37,"Among low- and middle-income countries, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia"
254,38,"(both of which have already implemented universal cash transfer schemes) have the high-"
254,39,"est financial inclusion levels, surpassing 90 percent; other countries in their respective"
254,40,"regions have account ownership levels below 25 percent, including Iraq and Cambodia."
254,41,"       This leaves around 1.7 billion adults worldwide still lacking access to an account,"
254,42,"with women, low-income households, and people with lower education levels"

256,2,"disproportionately represented (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). In 61 countries, fewer than"
256,3,"half of adults have an account; in 24 of these countries, account ownership drops below"
256,4,"one-third."
256,5,"       In such contexts, UBI implementation would be highly challenging in the near"
256,6,"future. But the rapid surge in account access in certain middle-income countries and the"
256,7,"evolution of supportive technologies provide cause for some optimism. Given the six-year"
256,8,"leap from 35 to 80 percent account ownership in a country as vast and populous as India,"
256,9,"widespread e-payments within five years seems feasible—with a concerted effort—in"
256,10,"many middle-income countries. For low-income countries, the average timeline would be"
256,11,"stretched, but Uganda’s progress from 20 to 59 percent ownership in six years suggests"
256,12,"that market and technology growth alongside financial inclusion initiatives can produce"
256,13,"rapid progress toward e-payment readiness even in less-developed settings."
256,14,"Summary"
256,15,"Compared to generating political consensus or finding financing for a UBI, the imple-"
256,16,"mentation challenges may be smaller. The ability to implement critically depends on"
256,17,"having or creating an enabling environment of widespread foundational ID and wide-"
256,18,"spread financial inclusion. Many countries are as yet far from universal coverage in this"
256,19,"regard, but the goals are already high on development agendas and there are numerous"
256,20,"successful experiences. Further, the lure of receiving a UBI payment may help mobi-"
256,21,"lize citizens to obtain IDs and bank accounts, once the regulatory and delivery systems"
256,22,"are developed and ready for rollout. Thus, if a country wants to implement a UBI and"
256,23,"gives development of the underlying systems full and determined political and techni-"
256,24,"cal support, they should be able to make progress in the time frame of a single political"
256,25,"administration."
256,26,"Conclusions"
256,27,"As discussed in previous chapters, a UBI looks simple in theory, but could prove more"
256,28,"challenging in practice. In this chapter, we have shown that the implementation of a UBI"
256,29,"would still require many of the same processes and systems as in the delivery chain"
256,30,"for social protection programs. Depending on the availability of universal ID and pay-"
256,31,"ment systems, substantial outreach using a range of communications methods may be"
256,32,"required to register the population. A UBI may use an integrated social registry covering"
256,33,"multiple social protection programs with individual- instead of household-level files. Reg-"
256,34,"istration may be through a one-time census sweep, through on-demand methods, or by"
256,35,"linking to other administrative databases through an interoperability framework for data"
256,36,"sharing across government. This would need to be conducted with the appropriate data"
256,37,"protection and privacy protocols in place."
256,38,"       Under a UBI, a simple automated screening may take the place of complex assess-"
256,39,"ments of needs and conditions. There is little to no variation in benefit levels, with"
256,40,
257,1,"Chapter 7. What Does It Take to Deliver a Universal Basic Income in Practice?                   233"
257,2,"potentially only a lower benefit value for children, or slight adjustments over time based"
257,3,"on the cost of living. A UBI program would utilize bulk payments administration and"
257,4,"transactions with the individual as the unit of assistance, rather than the household head."
257,5,"Improvements in payments infrastructure and public financial management systems"
257,6,"would be necessary to enable these transactions seamlessly to financial or nonfinancial"
257,7,"accounts. Monitoring systems would be critical to ensure complete, on-time payments to"
257,8,"intended recipients and to check for error, fraud, duplication, or corruption, as well as to"
257,9,"address grievances, complaints, and appeals."

295,3,"Methodology"
295,4,"T"
295,5,"       he main source of information for the microsimulations in chapter 4 is the Atlas"
295,6,"       of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) database (http://"
295,7,"       datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/). The database collects both administrative and"
295,8,"       household survey information on social protection programs for over 120 devel-"
295,9,"oping countries. The administrative database collects program-level information on"
295,10,"social protection programs including spending, number of beneficiaries, and program"
295,11,"design features. We use the database to validate/compare total amounts spent on social"
295,12,"protection programs from administrative data, with the total benefit amount of social"
295,13,"protection programs captured in the household surveys."
295,14,"      Administrative data were available for 9 out of 10 countries (Haiti does not have"
295,15,"administrative data, and World Bank staff estimates have been used for the Russian Fed-"
295,16,"eration; see table D.1). For those countries where administrative data were available, we"
295,17,"only considered programs captured in both the household survey and the administrative"
295,18,"data. The year of administrative data used in each country is the same as the year of its"
295,19,"household survey—except for Chile, where we used the most recent administrative data"
295,20,"for 2015 instead of 2013. Program (or subprogram) information was not always available"
295,21,"in the administrative database. In Nepal, the administrative database did not disaggre-"
295,22,"gate the old age, single woman, disability, and endangered ethnicities pensions, as well"
295,23,"as the child grants, while the household survey shows the information by program."
295,24,"      The ASPIRE household survey database collects household-level information on"
295,25,"social protection programs, welfare indicators (income, expenditure, or consumption),"
295,26,"and household demographic characteristics. We use these databases for the universal"
295,27,"basic income (UBI) simulations in each country. The chapter is based on 10 household"
295,28,"surveys (table D.1); in each country, the survey was the most recent one in the ASPIRE"
295,29,"database. The databases consist of both household surveys and specific social protection"
295,30,"surveys, as in Russia. We used the harmonized World Bank welfare indicator for Brazil,"
295,31,"Chile, Haiti, Kazakhstan, and Nepal. For Indonesia, Mozambique, and South Africa, the"
295,32,"harmonized welfare indicator was not available; for Russia, the survey is a specific house-"
295,33,"hold-level social protection survey. For these countries and India, we use the national"
295,34,"welfare variable included in the surveys."

296,44,"all, the total amount spent on each program according to administrative data remains"
296,45,"similar to the benefit amount captured in the household survey. Nevertheless, the total"
296,46,"amount captured in the household survey often remains slightly lower (as in Brazil, Chile,"
296,47,"Kazakhstan, Mozambique, and Nepal). This often relates to the small size of the pro-"
296,48,"grams, which are not always accurately captured in the surveys. In South Africa, the total"
296,49,"amount from the household survey is greater than that from the administrative database"
296,50,"because benefit values were imputed, and some households may not have received all"
296,51,"the transfers on a regular basis. Note that these small discrepancies between the survey"
296,52,"data and the administrative databases do not significantly affect our analysis as, in each"
296,53,"country, the UBI transfer is based on the transfers as captured in each survey; therefore,"
296,54,"our findings remain internally consistent."

299,15,"imputed the subsidies for rice, wheat, sugar, and kerosene for the three types of ration"
299,16,"cardholders defined in the survey (BPL, Antyodaya, Others). The PDS subsidy was esti-"
299,17,"mated as follow:"
299,18,"                PDS subsidy = PDS quantity × (Market price − PDS price)"
299,19,"where PDS subsidy= subsidies received by the households; PDS price = (value/quantity)"

301,22,"To capture the impact on living standards after considering the financing mechanisms, the"
301,23,"relevant welfare indicator is per capita consumable income, defined as disposable income"

301,25,"scenario is welfare increasing or welfare reducing, we compare the poverty, inequality,"
301,26,"and decile-based income averages measured with consumable income (instead of dis-"
301,27,"posable income) under each of the transfers-cum-financing scenarios against the same"
301,28,"indicators, but measured with consumable income for the baseline scenario. Since in"
301,29,"almost all cases the amount spent on subsidies is insufficient to cover the deficit even if"
301,30,"subsidies were eliminated in full, we do not report the results of the financing scenario"
301,31,"that replaces subsidies. Also, the financing gap for the fourth UBI scenario (where every-"

303,3,"If there is no information on place of purchase, some studies assume that households in"
303,4,"rural areas do not pay consumption taxes. Note that the way in which each of the under-"
303,5,"lying studies accounts for consumption tax informality is not harmonized; hence, for"
303,6,"details we refer to the country studies cited above."
303,7,"      To calculate consumable income for the baseline and each of the nine “without"
303,8,"and with financing” scenarios for the six countries in question, we applied the respective"
303,9,"incidence of indirect taxes and indirect subsidies by disposable income decile from the"
303,10,"Commitment to Equity Data Center to the per capita disposable income generated with"
303,11,"the household surveys. In using the incidence by decile, we are assuming that there is"
303,12,"no variation of incidence within a decile. This, of course, is not empirically fully accurate,"
303,13,"but within-decile patterns of consumption are likely to be sufficiently similar for the pur-"
303,14,"poses of our analysis. Note also that, given that the impacts change relatively little with"
303,15,"respect to the scenarios without financing, we do not expect any bias from the approx-"
303,16,"imation to be large."
303,17,"      To calculate the financing gap, we first calculate the difference between the cost of"
303,18,"transfers under the corresponding UBI scenario and the cost of transfers in the baseline."
303,19,"We call this the gross financing gap; it is likely to be a positive number except for the"
303,20,"budget-neutral UBI scenario, where spending on transfers under a UBI is kept the same"
303,21,"as in the baseline, so by definition this difference will be zero. Note that the gross financ-"
303,22,"ing gap does not fully correspond to the actual financing gap (the amount needed to be"
303,23,"raised in additional taxes or reduced in subsidies), because under the UBI scenarios that"
303,24,"are not budget neutral, disposable income will be higher (everything else being equal)."
303,25,"In turn, higher disposable income generates higher consumption; thus, revenues from"
303,26,"indirect taxes and spending on indirect subsidies will increase automatically as a result."
303,27,"The financing gap (the needed additional budgetary resources) is the net effect between"
303,28,"the difference obtained in the first step and the latter."
303,29,"      The total new automatically induced indirect taxes (and indirect subsidies) are cal-"
303,30,"culated multiplying the incidence of taxes (subsidies) by decile from the Commitment"
303,31,"to Equity Data Center on the new post-UBI disposable income. Direct taxes, in contrast,"
303,32,"are calculated using incidence of direct taxes by decile but multiplied by the baseline"
303,33,"disposable income. In essence, we are assuming that cash transfers are not subject to"
303,34,"personal income tax, which is generally true in developing countries. To calculate the"
303,35,"financing gap of alternative financing schemes, we need to take the difference between"
303,36,"these totals and the gross financing gap. The financing gap divided by direct taxes"
303,37,"collected in the baseline yields the proportion by which direct taxes paid by each indi-"
303,38,"vidual would have to increase in order to eliminate the financing gap. In the case of"
303,39,"indirect taxes, because the actual collection is higher than the total in the baseline (as"
303,40,"a result of the automatic mechanism described above), this proportion is calculated as"
303,41,"the ratio of the financing gap divided by the new post-UBI total indirect taxes. In the sce-"
303,42,"nario where the gap is financed by a lump-sum increase in direct taxes for the richest"
303,43,"decile, the financing gap just needs to be added to the direct taxes paid by this group"
303,44,"in the baseline."

304,3,"considered is market income (earnings, nonlabor income, private transfers) plus contrib-"
304,4,"utory pensions. In other words, we assume that contributory pensions are either pure"
304,5,"deferred income or are part of the salary package (i.e., public servants are paid lower sal-"
304,6,"aries than in the private sector but with more generous pensions to encourage retention)"

318,14,"    potential trade-offs between targeting transfers toward low-income households versus provid-"
318,15,"    ing a universal basic income. It starts by discussing how the fact that most households in poor"
318,16,"    countries do not pay income taxes changes how we conceptually think about universal basic"
318,17,"    income. It then analyzes data from two countries, Indonesia and Peru, to document the trade-"
318,18,"    offs involved. The results suggest that, despite the imperfections in targeting using proxy"
318,19,"    means tests, targeted transfers may result in substantially higher welfare gains than universal"
318,20,"    programs. However, targeted transfers do create an implied tax on consumption in the region"
318,21,"    where benefits are phased out. The authors discuss how alternative targeting approaches,"
318,22,"    such as community targeting and self-targeting, can be used to further improve targeting in"
318,23,"    some situations. https://www.nber.org/papers/w24939"

325,13,"    with a personal income above US$30,000, a surtax would be levied that reimburses the grant"

336,17,"    particular, he discusses the notions of dependence, independence, reciprocity, and free riding"

336,19,"    such a perspective, the article argues, would show the superiority of unconditional benefits in"

336,25,"    anism and argues that at least one form, classical liberalism, is compatible with and provides"
336,26,"    some grounds of support for UBI. A classical liberal UBI, however, is likely to be much smaller"
336,27,"    than the sort of UBI advocated by those on the political left. Moreover, there are both empir-"
