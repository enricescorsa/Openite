  Compounds","  I have carried out numerical first principles calculations of the pressure
dependence of the elastic moduli for several ordered structures in the
Aluminum-Lithium system, specifically FCC Al, FCC and BCC Li, L1_2 Al_3Li, and
an ordered FCC Al_7Li supercell. The calculations were performed using the full
potential linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) to calculate the total
energy as a function of strain, after which the data was fit to a polynomial
function of the strain to determine the modulus. A procedure for estimating the
errors in this process is also given. The predicted equilibrium lattice
parameters are slightly smaller than found experimentally, consistent with
other LDA calculations. The computed elastic moduli are within approximately
10% of the experimentally measured moduli, provided the calculations are
carried out at the experimental lattice constant. The LDA equilibrium shear
modulus C11-C12 increases from 59.3 GPa in Al, to 76.0 GPa in Al_7Li, to 106.2
GPa in Al_3Li. The modulus C_44 increases from 38.4 GPa in Al to 46.1 GPa in
Al_7Li, then falls to 40.7 GPa in Al_3Li. All of the calculated elastic moduli
increase with pressure with the exception of BCC Li, which becomes elastically
unstable at about 2 GPa, where C_11-C_12 vanishes.

weak-line TTS. Our study gives the following results: 1)At luminosities $\ge
0.9 L\sun$ the Li abundances are remarkably uniform, with a mean value,
log~N(Li)=3.1, equal to the ""cosmic"" lithium abundance. 2)Significant Li
depletion appears below 0.5~L$\sun$ in the mass range 0.9-0.2 M$\sun$ and
increases towards lower luminosities. At the lower mass end (0.4-0.2 M$\sun$),
the observed luminosity of the Li burning turning point is about a factor 4
higher than predicted by the models. At masses 1.2-1.0 M$\sun$ the observations
imply less PMS Li burning than theoretically expected. Moreover we show that:
1)Low Li abundances appear only among stars with low $v\sin{i}$. Fast rotators
with masses around 0.8~M$\sun$ do not show evidence for strong Li depletion
towards lower luminosities as slow rotators do. 2)In a sample restricted to
only K5-K7 stars we find that the angular momentum spread before Li burning
begins is larger than a factor 10. Lithium depletion associated to angular
momentum loss during PMS evolution is not required to explain the observed
abundances. The efficiency of PMS Li burning in the mass range 0.9-0.7~M$\sun$
is reduced in the presence of rapid rotation.

alternative gravity theory. This fourth-order theory is attractive because it
is the only metric theory of gravity which is invariant under local conformal
transformations of the metric. We calculate the primordial light element
abundances in this theory. The major difference {}from the standard cosmology
is that the universe expands far more slowly throughout the nucleosynthesis
epoch. The production of $^4\rm{He}$ depends strongly on $\eta$, the ratio of
baryons to photons. For $\eta = 10^{-8}$ the mass fraction of $^4{\rm He}$ is
$X_4 \simeq 0.25$ and the number densities relative to hydrogen for $^2{\rm
H}$, $^3{\rm He}$ and $^7{\rm Li}$ are $n(^2{\rm H})/n({\rm H}) \simeq 9\times

mass density close to the standard model critical density. However, adjusting
$\eta$ to give a reasonable helium yield forces the deuterium and lithium
yields to be small enough that the theory cannot be reconciled with
observations.

$6000-6600$~K, the $^7$Li/$^6$Li ratio on the subgiant branch should increase
as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$ if flare production is important, whereas the
same ratio should be constant if a protostellar origin is the source of the

only slightly ($\pm$0.005~M$_\odot$) on the interior models. None of the field
brown dwarf candidates in our sample appears to be a very young (age

Pleiades members known (V=20.7) the Li test implies a mass greater than
$\sim$0.08~M$_\odot$, and therefore it is not a brown dwarf. From our spectra
we estimate spectral types for some objects and present measurements of Halpha
emission strengths and radial velocities. Finally, we compare the positions in
the H-R diagram of our sample of brown dwarf candidates with the theoretical
region where Li is expected to be preserved (Substellar Lithium Region). We
find that certain combinations of temperature calibrations and evolutionary
tracks are consistent with the constraints imposed by the observed Li depletion

of lithium in Pop I and Pop II stars. Large corrections for unseen LiII and for
non-gas phase lithium have provided obstacles to using interstellar data for
abundance determinations. An approach to surmounting these difficulties is
proposed and is applied to the Galaxy and the LMC. The key is that since
potassium and lithium behave similarly regarding ionization and depletion,
their observed ratio (LiI/KI) can be used to probe the abundance and evolution
of lithium. For ten lines-of-sight in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy
(ISM) the Li/K ratio observed $(\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM} = - 1.88 \pm 0.09)$ is
entirely consistent with the solar system value $(\log (N_{Li}/N_{K})_{\odot} =
- 1.82 \pm 0.05)$. The absence of LiI in front of SN87A in the LMC, coupled
with the observed KI, corresponds to an upper bound (at $\rsim 95 \% \ CL$) of
$\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{LMC} < - 0.3 + \log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM}.$ This low upper
bound to LMC lithium suggests that cosmic lithium is on its way up from a
primordial abundance lower, by at least a factor of two, than the present Pop I
value of $[Li]_{PopI} \equiv 12 + \log (Li/H)_{PopI} = 3.2 \pm 0.1$.

  Mass Red Giants, Due to Deep Circulation","  It has been demonstrated that Li-7 can be created in low mass red giant
stars, via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, due to extra deep mixing and the
associated ""cool bottom processing"" (CBP). Under certain conditions, this Li-7
creation can take the place of the Li-7 destruction normally expected. Note
that such extra mixing on the red giant branch (RGB) has previously been
invoked to explain the observed C-13 enhancements. This new Li-7 production can
account for the recent discovery of surprisingly high lithium abundances in
some low mass red giants (a few of which are super-rich lithium stars, with
abundances higher than that in the interstellar medium). The amount of Li-7
produced can exceed log epsilon(Li-7) = 4, but depends critically on the
details of the extra mixing mechanism (mixing speeds, geometry, episodicity).
If the deep circulation is a relatively long-lived, continuous process,
lithium-rich RGB stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and boron. CBP
also leads to He-3 destruction in low mass stars; in contrast to Li-7 creation,
the extent of He-3 depletion is largely independent of the details of the extra
mixing mechanism. The overall contribution from solar-metallicity stars (1 - 40
Msun) is expected to be net destruction of He-3, with overall He-3 survival
fraction g_3 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 (weighted average) --- in contrast to standard
dredge-up, which would predict stars are net producers of He-3 (g_3:dr = 2.4
+/- 0.5). Pop II stars experience even more severe He-3 depletion, with 0.3 <
g_3 < 0.7. Destruction of He-3 in low mass stars is consistent with the
requirements of galactic chemical evolution models; it would also result in
some relaxation of the upper bound on the primordial (D + He-3)/H abundance.

  Light-Element Depletion","  We have computed new solar models using the same stellar evolution code as
described in Charbonnel, Vauclair and Zahn (1992). This code, originating from
Geneva, now includes the computation of element segregation for helium and 12
heavier isotopes. It may also include any type of mixing of the stellar gas,
provided this mixing may be parametrized with an effective diffusion
coefficient as a function of radius. Here we introduced rotation-induced mixing
as prescribed by Zahn (1992). We present five solar models: the standard model;
two models including pure element segregation; two models with both element
segregation and rotation-induced mixing. The $u = {P \over \rho }$ function
computed as a function of radius in these new solar models are compared to the
helioseismological results obtained for the same function by Dziembowski et al
(1994). Improving the physics of the models leads to a better consistency with
helioseismology. In our best model, which includes both segregation and mixing,
the relative difference in the $ u $ function between the model and the
helioseismological results is smaller than 0.5 per cent at all radii except at
the center and the surface. Meanwhile lithium is depleted by a factor 155 and
beryllium by a factor 2.9, which is consistent with the observations. The
bottom of the convective zone lies at a fractional radius of 0.716, consistent
with helioseismology. The neutrino fluxes are not decreased in any of these
models. The models including the computations of element segregation lead to a
present surface helium abundance of: $ Y_{surf} $ between 0.248 and 0.258,
which is in satisfactory agreement with the value derived from helioseismology.

reviewed. The similarities and differences between convection in stellar
envelopes and laboratory convection at high Rayleigh numbers are discussed.
Direct numerical simulation of the solar surface layers, with no other input
than atomic physics, the equations of hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is
now capable of reproducing the observed heat flux, convection velocities,
granulation patterns and line profiles with remarkably accuracy. These results
show that convection in stellar envelopes is an essentially non-local process,
being driven by cooling at the surface. This differs distinctly from the
traditional view of stellar convection in terms of local concepts such as
cascades of eddies in a mean superadiabatic gradient. The consequences this has
for our physical picture of processes in the convective envelope are
illustrated with the problems of sunspot heat flux blocking, the eruption of
magnetic flux from the base of the convection zone, and the Lithium depletion
problem.

Lyman limit hydrogen clouds challenge the usual picture of primordial
nucleosynthesis based on \lq\lq concordance\rq\rq\ of the calculated light
element ($^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^7$Li) nucleosynthesis yields with the
observationally-inferred abundances of these species. Concordance implies that
all light element yields can be made to agree with the observationally-inferred
abundances (within errors) for single global specifications of the
baryon-to-photon ratio, $\eta$; lepton number; neutron lifetime; and expansion
rate (or equivalently, effective number of light neutrino degrees of freedom
$N_{\nu} $). Though one group studying Lyman limit systems obtains a high value
of $^2$H/H ($\sim 2\times {10}^{-4}$), another group finds consistently low
values ($\sim 2\times {10}^{-5}$). In the former case, concordance for $N_{\nu}
=3$ is readily attained for the current observationally-inferred abundances of
$^4$He and $^7$Li. But if the latter case represents the primordial deuterium
abundance, then concordance for {\it any} $N_{\nu}$ is impossible unless the
primordial value of $^7$Li/H is considerably larger than the abundance of
lithium as measured in old, hot Pop II halo stars. Furthermore, concordance
with $N_{\nu}=3$ is possible for low $^2$H/H only if either (1) the primordial
$^4$He abundance has been significantly underestimated, or (2) new neutrino
sector physics is invoked. We argue that systematic underestimation of both the
$^7$Li and $^4$He primordial abundances is the likely resolution of this
problem, a conclusion which is strengthened by new results on $^4$He.

our model essentially due to a larger fissility of antimony. This is checked by
repeating the calculations for Na$_{52}^{++}$ with a bulk fissility parameter
set artificially equal to the value of Sb.

we found no evidence for intrinsic dispersion, a tiny trend with Teff and no

in contracting, fully convective, pre-main sequence stars of mass M < 0.5
M_sun. Previous numerical work relies on still-uncertain physics (atmospheric
opacities and convection, in particular) to calculate the effective temperature
as a unique function of stellar mass. We assume that the star's effective
temperature, T_eff, is fixed during Hayashi contraction and allow its actual
value to be a free parameter constrained by observation. Using this
approximation, we compute lithium burning analytically and explore the
dependence of lithium depletion on T_eff, M, and composition. Our calculations
yield the radius, age, and luminosity of a pre-main sequence star as a function
of lithium depletion. This allows for more direct comparisons to observations
of lithium depleted stars. Our results agree with those numerical calculations
that explicitly determine stellar structure during Hayashi contraction. In
agreement with Basri, Marcy, and Graham (1996), we show that the absence of
lithium in the Pleiades star HHJ 3 implies that it is older than 100 Myr. We
also suggest a generalized method for dating galactic clusters younger than 100
Myr (i.e., those with contracting stars of M > 0.08 M_sun) and for constraining
the masses of lithium depleted stars.

5 stars belonging to the old (14 Gyrs), metal rich ([Fe/H]=-0.7) globular
cluster 47Tuc. At the ESO NTT telescope we obtained EMMI spectra for three V
about 17.4 magnitude stars located at the turnoff with Teff on the Spite
plateau. In two of the turnoff stars the lithium line is clearly detected and
the mean lithium content [Li] = 2.37$+/- 0.08 +/- 0.07 is derived. This value
is slightly higher than the Spite plateau at [Li]=2.19 +/- 0.016 for field halo
stars obtained with the same Teff scale by Bonifacio and Molaro (1996). For the
third turnoff star only an upper limit could be derived: [Li] < 2.19. This
upper limit may suggest the presence of some dispersion on the plateau stars of
47Tuc as it is observed in field stars of similar metallicity. When compared
with field dwarfs of [Fe/H] about -0.7 the Li content of 47Tuc turnoff stars is
among the highest observed. Considering the extreme age of 47Tuc this suggests
that no significant depletion affected these stars and it implies a mild Li
Galactic enrichment between the epoch of Pop II formation and the formation of
47Tuc stars with metallicities up to about -0.7. Spallation reactions, as
deduced from Be observations, can account for such an increase. The remaining
two stars are evolved, and only upper limits could be placed at [Li]<0.7 and
<-0.7. These very low values imply some extra depletion mechanism in addition
to dilution as it is observed in evolved field stars by Pilachowki et al (1993)
and in NGC6397 by Pasquini and Molaro (1996).

this tunneling degree of freedom is approximated by a two-level-system. We
investigate the observable differences between the two models in three
contexts. First we show that the two models predict different relations between
the temperature dependence of specific heat and static susceptibility. Second
we demonstrate that in the presence of external forces (pressure and electric
field) the eight-state-system shows features that cannot be understood within
the framework of the two-level-approximation. In this context we propose an
experiment for measuring the parameter for tunneling along the face diagonal.
Finally we discuss the differences between the models appearing for strongly
coupled pairs. Geometric selection rules and particular forms of asymmetry lead
to clear differences between the two models.

chromospherically active binary stars (CABS). Since most of these binaries have
known radii, masses and ages, this kind of data is especially useful for
comparisons with theoretical models which try to explain the Li depletion
phenomenon. We show that a significant part of these stars have clear Li
overabundances. These excesses are evident when comparing our sample of CABS
with binary and single stars belonging to open clusters of different ages,
namely Pleiades, Hyades, NGC752, M67 and NGC188. The Li excesses are more
conspicuous for masses in the range 0.75-0.95 Mo, indicating that the rate of
Li depletion has been less pronounced in CABS than in single stars. This
phenomenon is interpreted in the context of transport of angular momentum from
the orbit to the stellar rotation due to tidal effects. Other explanations,
however, can not be ruled out. This is the case of transport of material
induced by internal gravity waves, which could be inhibited due to the presence
of strong magnetic fields associated with the effective dynamo in CABS. The
confirmed existence of a relation between Li and fluxes in CaII H&K lines can
also be accommodated within both scenarios.

the agreement with the observed solar frequencies and agree with the SRM within

the neutrino problem. Neither microscopic diffusion nor overshooting explain
the observed lithium depletion consistently with helioseismological

accuracy of solar models still needs to be improved by one magnitude; any such
improvement will necessitate equation of state and opacity data taking into

may come from lower mass companions. The X-ray-selected stars lie along a

which is considerably older than the estimated ages of the higher mass stars or
of the IR-excess stars. We determine the physical characteristics of these

the problem of rotational mixing in halo stars. The distribution of initial
conditions inferred from young clusters produces a well-defined halo lithium
""plateau"" with modest scatter and a small population of outliers. Different
choices for the solar calibration produce a range of absolute depletion
factors. We show that both the dispersion and the ratio of $^6$Li depletion to
$^7$Li depletion increase as the absolute $^7$Li depletion increases. The
measured $^6$Li in HD 84937 and the dispersion in the plateau set independent
upper bounds on the $^7$Li depletion. Consistency with open clusters and the
Sun, along with claims of an intrinsic dispersion in the plateau, set a lower
bound. We derive a range of 0.2-0.4 dex $^7$Li depletion in halo field stars.

speed and density as a function of solar radius. In order to infer the
temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles inside the Sun, it becomes
necessary to use, in addition, the equations of thermal equilibrium along with
the input physics, such as opacities, equation of state and nuclear reaction
rates. It then becomes possible to estimate the effects of uncertainties in
opacity and nuclear reaction rates on the inferred thermal and composition
profiles. The seismically determined temperature and hydrogen abundance
profiles turn out to be close to those in a standard evolutionary solar model
that includes the diffusion of helium and heavy elements below the convection
zone. The most significant departure occurs just below the base of the
convection zone where the inferred hydrogen abundance profile is smoother than
that in a standard diffusion model. The region just beneath the solar
convection zone appears to be mixed, a process which could account for the
observed low lithium abundance in the solar envelope. With a reasonable
allowance for errors in opacities, the helioseismically estimated cross-section
for pp nuclear reaction rate turns out to be (4.15+/-0.25)*1.E-25 MeV barns.

  Depletion","  Abundance measurements of the light elements lithium, beryllium, and boron
are playing an increasingly important role in the study of stellar physics.
Because these elements are easily destroyed in stars at temperatures 2--4
million K, the abundances in the surface convective zone are diagnostics of the
star's internal workings. Standard stellar models cannot explain depletion
patterns observed in low mass stars, and so are not accounting for all the
relevant physical processes. These processes have important implications for
stellar evolution and primordial lithium production in big bang
nucleosynthesis. Because beryllium is destroyed at slightly higher temperatures
than lithium, observations of both light elements can differentiate between the
various proposed depletion mechanisms. Unfortunately, the reaction rate for the
main destruction channel, 9Be(p,alpha)6Li, is uncertain. A level in the
compound nucleus 10B is only 25.7 keV below the reaction's energetic threshold.
The angular momentum and parity of this level are not well known; current
estimates indicate that the resonance entrance channel is either s- or d-wave.
We show that an s-wave resonance can easily increase the reaction rate by an
order of magnitude at temperatures of approximately 4 million K. Observations
of sub-solar mass stars can constrain the strength of the resonance, as can
experimental measurements at lab energies lower than 30 keV.

All these binaries have reliable ages, since they are members of well-known
open clusters or, in the case of the CABS, some stellar parameters such masses
and radii are accurate enough to derive ages using theoretical isochrones.
Their age span covers from barely one hundred million years to several
gigayears. We have compared different stellar properties, such as lithium
abundances, stellar masses, effective temperatures and orbital periods.
  It is shown that, in general, close binaries have lithium abundances larger
than those characteristic of single stars or binaries with larger orbital
periods. The largest difference between the abundances of binaries and single

stars. Under the presumption that the pre--main-sequence star is always fully
mixed during contraction, we find that the burning of these rare light elements
can be computed analytically, even when the star is degenerate. Using the
effective temperature as a free parameter, we constrain the properties of
low-mass stars from observational data, independently of the uncertainties
associated with modeling their atmospheres and convection. Our analytic
solution explains the dependence of the age at a given level of elemental
depletion on the stellar effective temperature, nuclear cross sections, and
chemical composition. Most importantly, our results allow observers to
translate lithium non-detections in young cluster members into a
model-independent minimum age for that cluster. Using this procedure, we have
found lower limits to the ages of the Pleiades (100 Myr) and Alpha Persei (60
Myr) clusters. Recent experimental work on the low energy resonance in the
^10B(p,\alpha)^7Be reaction has greatly enhanced estimates of the destruction
rate of ^10B, making it possible for stars with M>0.1 M_sun to deplete both
^10B and ^11B before reaching the main sequence. Moreover, there is an
interesting range of masses, 0.085 M_sun < M < 0.13 M_sun, where boron
depletion occurs on the main sequence in less than a Hubble time, providing a

  Abundance","  Observational constraints on the primordial lithium abundance are important
for the evaluation of the baryonic density of the universe. Its precise
determination however suffers from uncertainties due to the possible depletion
of this element inside the stars. Here we present and discuss new results on
the lithium abundances in pop II stars obtained with most recent stellar models
including the best available physics. We show that it is possible to account
for the general behavior of lithium observed in pop II stars without any free
parameters. Macroscopic motions inside the stars are needed but it is not
necessary to specify their exact nature to interpret the observational data.
This constatation allows to derive a parameter-free value for the lithium
primordial abundance : log(Lip) = 2.35 +/- .10 in the log(H) = 12 scale.

  and rho 1 Cnc","  The Be II 3131 A doublet has been observed in the solar-type stars 16 Cyg A &
B and in the late G-type star rho 1 Cnc, to derive their beryllium abundances.
16 Cyg A & B show similar (solar) beryllium abundances while 16 Cyg B, which
has been proposed to have a planetary companion of ~2 M_Jup, is known to be
depleted in lithium by a factor larger than 6 with respect to 16 Cyg A.
Differences in their rotational histories which could induce different rates of
internal mixing of material, and the ingestion of a similar planet by 16 Cyg A
are discussed as potential explanations. The existence of two other solar-type
stars which are candidates to harbour planetary-mass companions and which show
lithium and beryllium abundances close to those of 16 Cyg A, requires a more
detailed inspection of the peculiarities of the 16 Cyg system.
  For rho 1 Cnc, which is the coolest known object candidate to harbour a
planetary-mass companion (M > 0.85 M_Jup), we establish a precise upper limit
for its beryllium abundance, showing a strong Be depletion which constrains the
available mixing mechanisms. Observations of similar stars without companions
are required to asses the potential effects of the planetary companion on the
observed depletion. It has been recently claimed that rho 1 Cnc appears to be a
subgiant. If this were the case, the observed strong Li and Be depletions could
be explained by a dilution process taking place during its post-main sequence
evolution.

phases of stellar evolution plays a crucial role in the comparison of the
predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis with the abundances observed in halo
stars. In the past a wide range of possible depletion factors, ranging from
minimal in standard (non-rotating) stellar models to as much as an order of
magnitude in models including rotational mixing have been suggested. Using
recent progress in the study of the angular momentum evolution of low mass
stars, which now permits the construction of theoretical models that reproduce
the angular momentum evolution of low mass open cluster stars, along with the
observed distribution of initial angular momenta inferred from stellar rotation
data in young open clusters, we study lithium depletion in main sequence halo
stars. We predict a well-defined, nearly flat (in T_eff) halo lithium plateau
with modest scatter and a small population of outliers. We also examine the
relative depletions of 6Li and 7Li finding that the dispersion in the plateau
and the 6Li/7Li depletion ratio scale with the absolute 7Li depletion. Using
observational data to bound the 7Li depletion in main sequence halo stars, we
find a maximum depletion of 0.4 dex is set by the observed dispersion and the
6Li/7Li depletion ratio, and a minimum depletion of 0.2 dex is required by both
the presence of highly overdepleted halo stars and consistency with the solar
and open cluster 7Li data. The cosmological implications of these bounds on the
primordial abundance of 7Li are discussed. (Abridged)

nuclear reactions) at a temperature around $\sim 2.5\times 10^6$ K. The lithium
destruction zone is typically located in the radiative region of a star. If the
radiative regions are stable, the observed surface value of lithium should
remain constant with time. However, comparison of the meteoritic and
photospheric Li abundances in the Sun indicate that the surface abundance of Li
in the Sun has been depleted by more than two orders of magnitude. This is not
predicted by solar models and is a long standing problem. Observations of Li in
open clusters indicate that Li depletion is occurring on the main sequence.
Furthermore, there is now compelling observational evidence that a spread of
lithium abundances is present in nearly identical stars. This suggests that
some transport process is occurring in stellar radiative regions. Helioseismic
inversions support this conclusion, for they suggest that standard solar models
need to be modified below the base of the convection zone. There are a number
of possible theoretical explanations for this transport process. The relation
between Li abundances, rotation rates and the presence of a tidally locked
companion along with the observed internal rotation in the Sun indicate that
the mixing is most likely induced by rotation. The current status of
non-standard (particularly rotational) stellar models which attempt to account
for the lithium observations are reviewed.

not contaminated by stellar Li sources which act on longer time scales. The
atmospheric abundance is currently derived from the LiI 6707 Angstroem
resonance transition and the validity of the models employed has been
questioned (Kurucz 1995). In this letter we report the first detection of the
Li I 6104 Angstroem 2^2P - 3^2D subordinate transition in the prototype
population II star HD 140283. The same Li abundance of (Li/H) =1.4x10^{-10} is
found consistent with both the resonance and subordinate lines. The two lines
form at different depths in the atmosphere implying that the 1-D homogeneous
atmospheric models used in the abundance determination are essentially correct.
When coupled with the standard big bang yields, the Li in the halo dwarfs

while there were flaws in earlier work, it is likely that Blanco 1 is close in
overall metallicity to the older Hyades cluster and more metal-rich than the
Pleiades. However, we find Blanco 1 has Li abundances and rotation rates
similar to the Pleiades, contradicting predictions from standard stellar
evolution models, in which convective pre-main sequence (PMS) Li depletion
should increase rapidly with metallicity. If the high metallicity of Blanco 1
is subsequently confirmed, our observations imply (1) that a currently unknown
mechanism severely inhibits PMS Li depletion, (2) that additional non-standard
mixing modes, such as those driven by rotation and angular momentum loss, are
then responsible for main sequence Li depletion between the ages of Blanco 1
and the Hyades, and (3) that in clusters younger than the Hyades, metallicity
plays only a minor role in determining the amount of Li depletion among G and K
stars. These conclusions suggest that Li abundance remains a useful age
indicator among young (less than 700 Myr) stars even when metallicities are

primordial Li abundance could be significantly larger than present day
Population II Li abundances, due to prior Li depletion.

the Li6 vs Fe/H evolution-as well as Be and B vs Fe/H-has difficulty in

also show that another key indicator of Li6BeB origin is the Li6/Be ratio which
also fits the available data if O/Fe is not constant at low metallicity.

quantities and it is generally not considered to be a cosmological probe.
However, recent major observational advances have produced an estimate of the
li6/li7 ratio in a few very old stars in the galactic halo which impacts the
question whether or not the lithium isotopes are depleted in the outer layers
of halo stars, through proton induced reactions at the base of (or below) the
convective zone. li6 is a pure product of spallation through the major
production reactions, fast oxygen and alphas interacting on interstellar H, He
(especially in the early Galaxy). The rapid nuclei are both synthesized and
accelerated by SN II. In this context, the \li6 evolution should go in step
with that of beryllium and boron, recently observed by the Keck and HST
telescopes. Li6 adds a new constraint on the early spallation in the Galaxy. In
particular, if confirmed, the Li6/Be9 ratio observed in two halo stars (HD
84937, BD +263578) gives strong boundary conditions on the composition and the
spectrum of the rapid particles involved. We show that Li6 is essentially
intact in halo stars, and a fortiori \li7. We can define a range of the Li6
abundance in the very early Galaxy consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis

particular, we examine the case in which the brown dwarf spirals-in, and the
accreted matter is deposited at the base of the convective envelope and in the
thin radiative shell surrounding the hydrogen burning shell. In our spherically
symmetric simulations, we explore the effects of different accretion rates and
we follow two scenarios in which the amounts of injected mass are equal to
$\sim 0.01$ and $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$. The calculations show that for high
accretion rates ($\dot M_{acc} = 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}$), the considerable
release of accretion energy produces a substantial expansion of the star and
gives rise to hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope. For
somewhat lower accretion rates ($\dot M_{acc} = 10^{-5} M_\odot yr^{-1}$), the
accretion luminosity represents only a small fraction of the stellar
luminosity, and as a result of the increase in mass (and concomitantly of the
gravitational force), the star contracts. Our simulations also indicate that
the triggering of thermal pulses is delayed (accelerated) if mass is injected
at a slower (faster) rate. We analyze the effects of this accretion process on
the surface chemical abundances and show that chemical modifications are mainly
the result of deposition of fresh material rather than of active
nucleosynthesis. Finally, we suggest that the accretion of brown dwarfs and
planets can induce the ejection of shells around giant stars, increase their
surface lithium abundance and lead to significant spin-up. The combination of
these features is frequently observed among G and K giant stars.

astrophysics. Specifically, the rare and fragile light nuclei Lithium,
Beryllium and Boron (LiBeB) are not generated in the normal course of stellar
nucleosynthesis (except Li7) and are, in fact, destroyed in stellar interiors.
This characteristic is reflected in the low abundance of these simple species.
Optical measurements of the beryllium and boron abundances in halo stars have
been achieved by the 10 meter KECK telescope and the Hubble Space
Telescope.These observations indicate a quasi linear correlation between Be and
B vs Fe, at least at low metallicity. Aside GCRs, which are accelerated in the
general interstellar medium (ISM) and create LiBeB through the break up of CNO
by fast protons and alphas, Wolf-Rayet stars (WR) and core collapse supernovae
(SNII) grouped in superbubbles could produce copious amounts of light elements
via the fragmentation in flight of rapid carbon and oxygen nuclei colliding
with H and He in the ISM.

to enable a precise measurement of the dispersion in the lithium abundance of
the Spite Li plateau. We concentrated on stars having a narrow range of
effective temperature and very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to reduce the
effects of systematic errors, and have made particular efforts to minimize
random errors in equivalent width and effective temperature. A typical formal
error for our abundances is 0.033 dex (1-sigma), which represents a factor of
two improvement on most previous studies. Our observed spread about the Li
Spite plateau is a mere 0.031 dex (1-sigma), hence we conclude the intrinsic
spread is effectively zero at the very metal-poor halo turnoff. We recover a
robust dependence of lithium abundance with metallicity, dA(Li)/d[Fe/H] = 0.118
+/- 0.023 dex per dex. Previous claims for a lack of dependence of A(Li) on
[Fe/H] are shown to have arisen from the use of noisier estimates of effective
temperatures and metallicities. Although we cannot rule out a uniform depletion
mechanism, the lack of spread in the A(Li) abundances limits permissible
depletion by current rotationally- induced mixing models to < 0.1 dex.
Correcting for the GCE contribution to both 6Li and 7Li, we infer a primordial
lithium abundance of A(Li) = 2.0 dex. We predict that observations of lithium
in extremely low-metallicity stars, having [Fe/H] < -3.0, will yield smaller
A(Li) values than the bulk of the stars in this sample, consistent with a low
primordial abundance.

spectra of super Li-rich AGB stars. The system of equations of the statistical
balance of neutral Li in plane-parallel model atmospheres is solved for a
20-level atom model. JOLA and line-by-line models of molecular absorption are
used to compute synthetic spectra as well as the opacity in the frequencies of
bound-bound and bound-free transitions of the lithium lines. Curves of growth
and synthetic spectra are computed in LTE and NLTE for several model
atmospheres of different Teff and C/O ratios for four lithium absorptions,
namely: the $\lambda 4603$, $\lambda 6104$, $\lambda 6708$ and $\lambda 8126$
{\AA} Li I lines. The sensitivity of the NLTE effects on Teff and the C/O ratio
is discussed. We found that NLTE mainly affects the resonance line doublet
($\lambda 6708$) while the impact of NLTE effects on the lithium subordinate
lines, formed in the inner regions of C-rich giant atmospheres, is rather weak.
Therefore the use of these lines is recommended for Li determination in AGB
stars. However, in no case can we properly account for the formation of Li
lines in AGB stars until sphericity, velocity stratifications, dust,
chromospheres and other related phenomena, which are in fact present in AGB
star atmospheres, are considered. Our results are used to derive Li abundances
in three super Li-rich C-stars taking into account NLTE effects. Finally, the
net Li yield from this class of stars into the interstellar medium is
reconsidered.

that the resulting photometric catalogues, combined with far-red optical data,
provide an extremely effective method of finding isolated, very low-temperature
objects in the general field. Follow-up observations have already identified
more than 25 sources with temperatures cooler than the latest M dwarfs. A
comparison with detailed model predictions (Burrows & Sharp) indicates that
these L dwarfs have effective temperatures between ~2000\pm100 K and 1500\pm100
K, while the available trigonometric parallax data place their luminosities at
between 10^{-3.5} and 10^{-4.3} L_solar. Those properties, together with the
detection of lithium in one-third of the objects, are consistent with the
majority having substellar masses. The mass function cannot be derived
directly, since only near-infrared photometry and spectral types are available
for most sources, but we can incorporate VLM/brown dwarf models in simulations
of the Solar Neighbourhood population and constrain Psi(M) by comparing the
predicted L-dwarf surface densities and temperature distributions against
observations from the DENIS and 2MASS surveys. The data, although sparse, can
be represented by a power-law mass function, Psi(M) ~ M^{-alpha}, with 1 <
alpha < 2. Current results favour a value nearer the lower limit. If alpha =
1.3, then the local space density of 0.075 > M/M_solar > 0.01 brown dwarfs is

group, 20 - 150 Myr), Ursa Mayor group (Sirius supercluster, 300 Myr), and
Hyades supercluster (600 Myr). Other moving groups as IC 2391 supercluster (35
Myr) and Castor Moving Group (200 Myr) have been also included. Stars have been
selected from previously established member of stellar kinematic groups based
in photometric and kinematic properties as well as from candidates based in
other criteria as their level of chromospheric activity, rotation rate, lithium
abundance. Precise measurements of proper motions and parallaxes taken from
Hipparcos Catalogue, and published radial velocity measurements are used to
calculate Galactic space motions (U, V, W) in order to determine the membership
of the selected stars to the different stellar kinematic groups. In addition to
kinematic properties we also give for each star photometric, spectroscopic and
physical properties as well as information about activity indicators and Li
abundance. Some chromospherically active binaries results to be also members of
some of these stellar kinematic groups.

to the spin-dependence of the ionization cross sections. Convergence is found
to be more rapid for the spin asymmetries, which are in good agreement with

LiI line have been obtained with the ESO Coude Echelle Spectrometer for five,
metal-poor (-0.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.6) disk stars in the turnoff region of the
HR-diagram. The instrumental and stellar atmospheric line broadening have been
determined from two unblended iron lines and used in a model atmosphere
synthesis of the profile of the LiI line as a function of the lithium isotope
ratio. This has led to a detection of 6Li in HD68284 and HD130551 with 6Li/7Li
= 0.05, whereas the other stars, HR2883, HR3578 and HR8181, have 6Li/7Li close
to zero.
  By comparing Teff-values and absolute magnitudes based on Hipparcos
parallaxes with recent stellar evolutionary tracks, the masses of the stars
have been derived. It is shown that the two stars with 6Li present have a
significantly higher mass, M = 1.05 M(sun), than the other three stars for
which values between 0.85 and 1.0 M(sun) are obtained.
  The results are discussed in terms of models for the galactic evolution of
the light elements and depletion of the lithium isotopes in stellar envelopes.
It is shown that the measured 6Li abundances are in agreement with standard
cosmic ray production of 6Li in the galactic disk and a moderate depletion (0.5
dex) in the stars. Recent models for the evolution of 6Li including alpha +
alpha fusion reactions and predicting a high lithium isotopic ratio, 6Li/7Li =
0.3 at [Fe/H] = -0.6, require a high degree of 6Li depletion (1.0 dex) to fit
the observations. Furthermore, these models imply a 7Li abundance about 0.2 dex
higher than observed for metal-poor disk stars.

lithium test (in 1995), though its inferred mass was very close to the
substellar limit. It is a member of the Pleiades open cluster. Its position in
a cluster color-magnitude diagram suggested that it might be binary, and
preliminary indications that it is a double-lined spectroscopic binary were
reported by us in 1997. Here we report on the results of a consecutive week of
Keck HIRES observations of this system, which yield its orbit. It has a period
of about 5.8 days, and an eccentricity of 0.4+/-0.05. The rotation of the stars
is slow for this class of objects. Because the system luminosity is divided
between 2 objects with a mass ratio of 0.85, this renders each of them an
incontrovertible brown dwarf, with masses between 60-70 jupiters. We show that
component B is a little redder than A by studying their wavelength-dependent
line ratios, and that this variation is compatible with the mass ratio. We
confirm that the system has lithium, but cannot support the original conclusion
that it is depleted (which would be surprising, given the new masses). This is
a system of very close objects which, if they had combined, would have produced
a low mass star. We discuss the implications of this discovery for the theories
of binary formation and formation of very low mass objects.

consistent with the formation of a ""black hole"" of infinite density

that similar-mass systems predominate, and that their distribution peaks at
radial distances in accord both with M dwarf binaries and with the radial
location of Jovian planets in our own solar system. To fully establish these

  slowly rotating stars : I Setting the stage","  It has been known for a long time (Mestel 1953) that the meridional
circulation velocity in stars, in the presence of mu-gradients, is the sum of
two terms, one due to the classical thermal imbalance (omega-currents) and the
other one due to the induced horizontal mu-gradients (mu-induced currents, of
mu-currents in short). In the most general cases, mu-currents are opposite to
omega-currents. Simple expressions for these currents are derived under some
simplifying physical assumptions presented in the text, and their physical
interpretations are discussed. Computations of the omega and mu-currents in a
0.8 Mo halo stellar model including classical element settling show that the
mu-currents are larger (in absolute values) than the omega-currents in all the
star : some new physics has thus to be invoked in this case. We show here how
such processes could possibly lead to a quasi-equilibrium stage in which both
the circulation and the helium settling could be cancelled out. As lithium
diffuses in the same way as helium, we expect a very small lithium
concentration gradient below the convective zone in ""plateau stars"" (main
sequence PopII stars), much smaller than the one expected for pure element
settling. This could possibly account for the very small dispersion observed
for the lithium abundances at the surface of these stars. This should also have
important consequences in other contexts which will be discussed in forthcoming
papers. The present computations show that element settling in slowly rotating
stars leads to surface abundances which depend on the competition between
mu-currents and omega-currents, in a way which had not been taken into account
in previous computations. This may change our general understanding of the
diffusion processes of chemical species in rotating stars.

cool stars like the Pleiades has proved a difficult challenge for stellar
evolution theory. We propose that Li abundances relative to a mean temperature
trend, rather than the absolute abundances, should be used to analyze the
spread in abundance. We present evidence that the dispersion in Li equivalent
widths at fixed color in cool single Pleiades stars is at least partially
caused by stellar atmosphere effects (most likely departures from ionization
predictions of model photospheres) rather than being completely explained by
genuine abundance differences. We find that effective temperature estimates
from different colors yield systematically different values for active stars.
There is also a strong correlation between stellar activity and Li excess, but
not a one-to-one mapping between unprojected stellar rotation (from photometric
periods) and Li excess. Thus, it is unlikely that rotation is the main cause
for the dispersion in the Li abundances. Finally, there is a strong correlation
between detrended Li excess and potassium excess but not calcium-- perhaps
supporting incomplete radiative transfer calculations (and overionization
effects in particular) as an important source of the Li scatter. Other
mechanisms, such as very small metallicity variations and magnetic fields,
which influence PMS Li burning may also play a role. Finally, we find no
statistical evidence for a decrease in dispersion in the coolest Pleiades
stars, contrary to some previous work.

  RW Aur","  It is widely accepted that much of the stochastic variability of T Tauri
stars is due to accretion by a circumstellar disk. The emission line spectrum
as well as the excess continuum emission are common probes of this process. In
this communication, we present additional probes of the circumstellar
environment in the form of resonance lines of low ionization potential
elements. Using a set of 14 high resolution echelle observations of the
classical T Tauri star (CTTS), RW Aur, taken between 1986 and 1996, we
carefully measure the continuum veiling at each epoch by comparing more than
500 absorption lines with those of an appropriate template. This allows us to
accurately subtract out the continuum emission and to recover the underlying
photospheric spectrum. In doing so, we find that selected photospheric lines
are enhanced by the accretion process, namely the resonance lines of LiI and
KI. A resonance line of TiI and a low excitation potential line of CaI also
show weak enhancements. Simple slab models and computed line bisectors lead us
to propose that these line enhancements are markers of cool gas at the
beginning of the accretion flow which provides an additional source of line
opacity. These results suggest that published values of surface lithium
abundances of classical T Tauri stars are likely to be overestimated. This
would account for the various reports of surface lithium abundances in excess
of meteoritic values among the extreme CTTS. Computing LTE lithium abundances
of RW Aur in a low and then high accretion state yields abundances which vary
by one order of magnitude. The low accretion state lithium abundance is
consistent with theoretical predictions for a star of this age and mass while
the high accretion state spectrum yields a super-meteoritic lithium abundance.

the binaries harboring black holes are fainter than those that contain a
neutron star. Narayan and collaborators postulated that the faint X-ray
emission from black hole binaries was powered by an advection dominated
accretion flow (ADAF). We explore an alternative explanation for the quiescent
X-ray emission from the black hole systems: coronal emission from the rapidly
rotating optical companion. This is commonly observed and well studied in other
tidally locked binaries, such as the RS CVns. We show that two of the three
X-ray detected black hole binaries (A0620-00 and GRO J1655-40) exhibit X-ray
fluxes entirely consistent with coronal emission. The X-ray spectra of these
objects should be best fit with thermal Raymond-Smith models rich in lines when
coronal emission predominates. One black hole system (V404 Cyg) is too X-ray
bright to be explained as coronal emission. The quiescent X-ray emission from
the neutron star binaries is far too bright for coronal emission. It might be
that all SXT's have variable accretion rates in quiescence and that the basal
quiescent X-ray flux is set by either coronal emission from the companion or --
when present -- by thermal emission from the neutron star. We also show that
the lithium abundances in the black hole systems are comparable to those in the
RS CVns, reducing the need for production mechanisms that involve the compact
object.

Hydrogen-deficiency can originate from mixing and subsequent convective burning

Dredge-up alone may also be responsible for hydrogen-deficiency of post-AGB
stars. Models of the last thermal pulse on the AGB with very small envelope
masses have shown efficient third dredge-up. The hydrogen content of the
envelope is diluted sufficiently to produce H-deficient post-AGB stars (AFTP).
Moreover, dredge-up alone may also cause H-deficiency during the Born-again
phase (LTP). During the second AGB phase a convective envelope develops. A
previously unknown lithium enrichment at the surface of Born-again stellar
models may be used to distinguish between objects with different post-AGB
evolution. The observed abundance ratios of C, O and He can be reproduced by
all scenarios if an AGB starting model with inclusion of overshoot is used for
the post-AGB model sequence.

stars, although the presence of some luminous (M$_{bol}<-5.5$) J-stars in our

of at least two types of J-stars, with different formation scenarios depending
upon the initial mass of the parent star. Standard evolutionary AGB models are
difficult to reconcile with all the observed chemical characteristics. In fact,
they suggest the existence of an extra-mixing mechanism which transports
material from the convective envelope down to hotter regions where some nuclear
burning occurs. This mechanism would act preferably on the early-AGB phase in
low-mass stars. Mixing at the He-core flash and the binary system hypothesis
are also discussed as alternatives to the above scenario.

  nucleosynthesis","  We present a Monte Carlo method for direct incorporation of nuclear inputs in
primordial nucleosynthesis calculations. This method is intended to remedy
shortcomings of current error estimation, by eliminating intermediate data
evaluations and working directly with experimental data, allowing error
estimation based solely on published experimental uncertainties. This technique
also allows simple incorporation of new data and reduction of errors with the
introduction of more precise data. Application of our method indicates that
previous error estimates on the calculated abundances were too large by as much
as a factor of three. Since uncertainties in the BBN calculation currently
dominate inferences drawn from light-element abundances, the re-estimated
errors have important consequences for cosmic baryon density, neutrino physics,
and lithium depletion in halo stars. Our direct method allows detailed
discussion of the status of the nuclear inputs, by identifying clearly the
places where improved cross section measurements would be most useful.

discussed. We show, that the processes of formation of spectra of M- and
L-dwarfs are basically different. Instead of the case of M-dwarfs, atoms of Ti
and V should be depleted into grains in the atmospheres of L-dwarfs. Overall
shape of the L-dwarf spectra is governed by the K I + Na I resonance line wings
of the huge strength. To fit lithium lines observed in spectra of the coolest
dwarfs we used two additional suggestions: a) there are some EXTRA depletions
of molecular species absorbed in the optical spectra of L-dwarfs; b) there may
be (a few?) additional (``dusty''?) opacity sources in their atmospheres.
Problems of lithium line formation and the ``natural'' limitation of their use
for the ``lithium test'' for the case of L-dwarfs are considered.

Fowler's compilation.
  ${^7}Li$ is slightly depressed at high baryon to photon ratio $\eta$.

the synthesis of ${^7}Li$ (via the ${^3}He(\alpha,\gamma){^7}Be(e\nu){^7}Li$)
at rather high baryonic density. On the left part of the lithium valley the
uncertainty is strongly reduced due to the improvement of the measurement of
the $T(\alpha,\gamma)^{7}Li$ reaction rate.
  We use lithium-7 as the main baryometer, since, though much efforts have been
devoted to the determination of Deuterium in absorbing clouds in the line of
sight of remote quasars, the statistics is very poor compared to the long
series of lithium measurements.
  Taking into account the lithium constraints, two possible baryonic density
ranges emerge,
  $\eta_{10}= 1.4 - 1.9$ and $\eta_{10} = 3.3 - 5.1$.

more than 10% in 3 Gyrs. Meanwhile the inversion of helioseismic modes lead to
a precision on the sound velocity of about .1%. The mixing processes below the

two terms, one due to the classical thermal imbalance (Omega-currents) and the
other one due to the induced horizontal mu-gradients (mu-induced currents, or
mu-currents in short). In the most general cases, mu-currents are opposite to
Omega-currents. Vauclair (1999) has shown that such processes can, in specific
cases, lead to a quasi-equilibrium stage in which both the circulation and the
helium settling is frozen. Here we present computations of the circulation
currents in halo star models, along the whole evolutionary sequences for four
stellar masses with a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2. We show that such a
self-regulated process can account for the constancy of the lithium abundances

Heidelberg heavy-ion storage ring TSR. We studied the center-of-mass energy
range 0--130 eV which covers all $\Delta n$=0 core excitations. The influence
of external crossed electric (0--300 V/cm) and magnetic (41.8--80.1 mT) fields

even if the Non-LTE effects are taken into account. For the rotation behaviour,
our analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low
rotational rate, while more massive stars are slowed down only when reaching
the subgiant branch. We also checked the connection between the observed
rotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the

  Survey (2MASS)","  We present JHKs photometry, far red spectra, and spectral classifications for
an additional 67 L dwarfs discovered by the Two Micron All Sky Survey. One of
the goals of this new search was to locate more examples of the latest L
dwarfs. Of the 67 new discoveries, 17 have types of L6 or later. Analysis of
these new discoveries shows that H-alpha emission has yet to be convincingly
detected in any L dwarf later than type L4.5, indicating a decline or absence
of chromospheric activity in the latest L dwarfs. Further analysis shows that
16 (and possibly 4 more) of the new L dwarfs are lithium brown dwarfs and that
the average line strength for those L dwarfs showing lithium increases until
roughly type L6.5 V then declines for later types. This disappearance may be
the first sign of depletion of atomic lithium as it begins to form into
lithium-bearing molecules. Another goal of the search was to locate nearer,
brighter L dwarfs of all subtypes. Using absolute magnitudes for 17 L dwarf
systems with trigonometric parallax measurements, we develop spectrophotometric
relations to estimate distances to the other L dwarfs. Of the 67 new
discoveries, 21 have photometric distances placing them within 25 parsecs of
the Sun. A table of all known L and T dwarfs believed to lie within 25 parsecs
- 53 in total - is also presented. Using the distance measurement of the
coolest L dwarf known, we calculate that the gap in temperature between L8 and
the warmest known T dwarfs is less than 350K and probably much less. If the
transition region between the two classes spans a very small temperature
interval, this would explain why no transition objects have yet been uncovered.
This evidence, combined with model fits to low-resolution spectra of late-M and
early-L dwarfs, indicates that L dwarfs span the range 1300K < Teff < 2000K.

approximately the same as its fine structure splitting (0.158 Angstroms),
resulting in a blend of the 7Li and 6Li lines. Use of the K I line as a

  Our high resolution observations show remarkably disparate isotope ratios:
7Li/6Li = 1 0.6 +/- 2.9 toward zeta Per and 3.6 +/- 0.6 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 toward
o Per. While the results toward zeta Per are consistent with the meteoritic
value, the ratio toward o Per's clouds suggest recent Galactic cosmic ray
spallation. This is the first clear and unambiguous evidence for an
interstellar 7Li/6Li ratio that differs dramatically from the Solar System
value. The low ratio indicates a higher cosmic ray flux toward o Per than
toward zeta Per. A higher flux of cosmic rays toward o Per was suggested
earlier in a study of OH and HD chemistry (Federman, Weber, & Lambert 1996, ApJ
463, 181).
  The total lithium abundances and the K/Li ratio are useful in placing the
7Li/6Li ratio into context. We obtained total lithium abundances of (12.2 +/-
2.2) x 10^(-10) toward zeta Per and (9.8 +/- 3.5) x 10^(-10) toward o Per. The
columns of K I and Li I yielded K/Li ratios that revealed no discernable trend.

[Fe/H] = -3.71 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.12 (random and systematic errors) -- somewhat
higher than previous estimates. We find [Mg/Fe] = 0.50, typical of values of
less extreme halo material. [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], however, all have
significantly lower values, ~ 0.0-0.1, suggesting that the heavier elements
might have been underproduced relative to Mg in the material from which this
object formed. In the context of the hypothesis that the abundance patterns of
extremely metal-poor stars are driven by individual enrichment events and the
models of Woosley and Weaver (1995), the data for CS 22876-032 are consistent
with its having been enriched by a zero-metallicity supernova of mass 30
M$_{\odot}$. As the most metal-poor near-main-sequence-turnoff star currently
known, the primary of the system has the potential to strongly constrain the
primordial lithium abundance. We find A(Li) (= log(N(Li)/N(H)) + 12.00) = 2.03
$\pm$ 0.07, which is consistent with the finding of Ryan et al. (1999) that for
stars of extremely low metallicity A(Li) is a function of [Fe/H].

  Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background","  We reanalyze the cosmological constraints on the existence of a net universal
lepton asymmetry and neutrino degeneracy. We show that neutrinos can begin to
decouple at higher temperatures than previous estimates due to several
corrections which diminish the neutrino reaction rate. These decoupled
neutrinos are therefore not heated as the particle degrees of freedom change.
The resultant ratio of the relic neutrino-to-photon temperatures after $e^\pm$
annihilation can then be significantly reduced by more than a factor of two
from that of the standard nondegenerate ratio. This changes the expansion rate
and subsequent primordial nucleosynthesis, photon decoupling, and structure
formation. In particular we analyze physically plausible lepton-asymmetric
models with large $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ degeneracies together with a
moderate $\nu_e$ degeneracy. We show that the nucleosynthesis by itself permits
very large neutrino degeneracies $0 \le \xinum$, $\xinut \le 40$, $0 \le \xinue
\le 1.4$ together with large baryon densities $0.1 \le \Omega_b \h502 \le 1$ as
long as some destruction of primordial lithium has occurred. We also show that
structure formation and the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background
allows for the possibility of an $\Omega = 1$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.4$,
cosmological model for which there is both significant lepton asymmetry ($|
\xinum | = | \xinut | \approx 11$) and a relatively large baryon density
($\Omega_b \h502 \approx 0.2$). Our best-fit neutrino-degenerate,
high-baryon-content models are mainly distinguished by a suppression of the
second peak in the microwave background power spectrum. This is consistent with
the recent high resolution data from BOOMERANG and MAXIMA-1.

and main sequence turnoff stars in the old open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). We
attempt to identify blue stragglers whose spectra are least contaminated by
binary effects (contamination by a binary companion or absorption by
circumstellar material). These ``best'' stragglers have metallicities ([Fe/H] =
-0.05) and abundance ratios of the blue stragglers are not significantly
different from those of the turnoff stars. Based on arguments from
hydrodynamical models of stellar collisions, we assert that the current upper
limits for the lithium abundances of all blue stragglers observed in M67 (by us
and others) are consistent with no mixing during the formation process,
assuming pre-main sequence and main sequence depletion patterns observed for
M67 main sequence stars. We discuss composition signatures that could more
definitively distinguish between blue straggler formation mechanisms in open
cluster stars.
  We confirm the spectroscopic detection of a binary companion to the straggler
S 1082. From our spectra, we measure a projected rotational speed of 90+/-20
km/sec for the secondary, and find that its radial velocity varies with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of ~ 25 km/sec. Because the radial velocities do not
vary with a period corresponding to the partial eclipses in the system, we
believe this system is currently undergoing mass transfer. In addition we
present evidence that S 984 is a true blue straggler (and not an unresolved
pair). If this can be proven, our detection of lithium may indicate a
collisional origin.

similar cloud-lets, which have dispersed recently. High-resolution spectra of
our new T Tauri stars show that they have significantly more lithium absorption
than zero-age main-sequence stars of the same spectral type, so that they are
indeed young. From those spectra we also obtained rotational and radial
velocities. For some stars we found the proper motion in published catalogs.
The direction and velocity of the 3D space motion - south relative to the

cyanide in alkali halides, with respect to an external field coupling to the
elastic quadrupole moment. Because of the particular level structure of a
eight-state system on a cubic site, the elastic response function shows a
biexponential relaxation feature and a van Vleck type contribution with a
resonance frequency that is twice the tunnel frequency $\Delta/\hbar$. This
basically differs from the dielectric response that does not show relaxation.
Moreover, we show that the elastic response of a [111] impurity cannot be
reduced to that of a two-level system. In the experimental part, we report on
recent sound velocity and internal friction measurements on KCl doped with
cyanide at various concentrations. At low doping (45 ppm) we find the dynamics
of a single [111] impurity, whereas at higher concentrations (4700 ppm) the
elastic response rather indicates strongly correlated defects. Our theoretical
model provides a good description of the temperature dependence of $\delta v/v$
and $Q^{-1}$ at low doping, in particular the relaxation peaks, the absolute
values of the amplitude, and the resonant contributions. From our fits we
obtain the value of the elastic deformation potential $\gamma_t=0.192$ eV.

pre main-sequence evolution, have been performed using the masses recently
determined by Pourbaix et al. (1999). Models have been constructed using the
CEFF equation of state, OPAL opacities, NACRE thermonuclear reaction rates and
microscopic diffusion. A chi^2-minimization is performed to derive the most
reliable set of modeling parameters wp={t_alpha Cen, Yi, [Fe/H]i, alpha A,
alpha B}, where t alpha Cen is the age of the system, Yi the initial helium
content, [Fe/H]i the initial metallicity and, alpha A and alpha B the

(1958) mixing-length theory of convection, we derive wp BV={2710 Myr,
0.284,0.257, 1.53, 1.57}. We obtain a noticeably smaller age than estimated
previously, in agreement with Pourbaix et al. (1999), mainly because of the
larger masses. If convective core overshoot is considered we get wp ov={3530
Myr, 0.279,0.264,1.64,1.66}. The use of Canuto & Mazitelli (1991, 1992)
convection theory leads to the set wp CM={4086 Myr, 0.271, 0.264, 0.964,

  A seismological analysis of our calibrated models has been performed. The
determination of large and small spacings between the frequencies of acoustic

the new determination of masses.

deficiency of two of these is a new discovery. Three of the four stars have
effective temperatures Teff ~ 6300 K, in contrast to previously known
Li-deficient halo stars which spanned the temperature range of the Spite
Plateau. In this paper we propose that these, and previously known
ultra-Li-deficient halo stars, may have had their surface lithium abundances
reduced by the same mechanism as produces halo field blue stragglers. Even
though these stars have yet to reveal themselves as blue stragglers, they might
be regarded as ""blue-stragglers-to-be."" In our proposed scenario, the surface
abundance of Li in these stars could be destroyed (a) during the normal
pre-main-sequence single star evolution of their low mass precursors, (b)
during the post-main-sequence evolution of a evolved mass donor, and/or (c) via
mixing during a mass-transfer event or stellar merger. The warmest Li-deficient
stars at the turnoff would be regarded as emerging ""canonical"" blue stragglers,
whereas cooler ones represent sub-turnoff-mass ""blue-stragglers-to-be."" The
latter are presently hidden on the main sequence, Li depletion being possibly
the clearest signature of their past history and future significance.
Eventually, the main sequence turnoff will reach down to their mass, exposing
those Li-depleted stars as canonical blue stragglers when normal stars of that
mass evolve away. Arguing against this unified view is the observation that the
three Li-depleted stars at Teff ~ 6300 K are all binaries, whereas very few of
the cooler systems show evidence for binarity; it is thus possible that two
separate mechanisms are responsible for the production of Li-deficient
main-sequence halo stars.

Furthermore, the spectral energy distribution and the TiO bands in the red part

reddening of E(B-V)=0.44 (L(F)/L(M)=1.8) and indicates that the companion must
also be strongly evolved and probably evolving along the AGB. Neither our

binary interaction. Most interestingly, a strong lithium resonance line is
detected, which yields an abundance of log(Li)=3.6. Several explanations for

metallicity [Fe/H] of a subset of 466 main sequence stars, when plotted as a
function of stellar mass, mimics the pattern seen in lithium abundances in open
clusters. Using Monte Carlo models we find that, on average, these stars have
accreted about 0.4 Earth masses of iron while on the main sequence. A much
smaller sample of 19 stars in the Hertzsprung gap, which are slightly evolved
and whose convection zones are significantly more massive, have lower average
[Fe/H], and their metallicity shows no clear variation with stellar mass. These
findings suggest that terrestrial-type material is common around solar type
stars.

flavor. In this contribution I will discuss new models of stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis models of this phase. Two most intriguing properties of
Sakurai's objects have so far not been understood theoretically: the peculiar
chemical appearance, in particular the high lithium abundance and the short
time scale of only a few years on which the transition from the dwarf
configuration into the born again giant appearance has occurred. A new
nucleosynthesis mode of hot hydrogen-deficient He3 burning can explain the
extraordinary lithium abundance. During the thermal pulse He3 is ingested from
the envelope together with the protons into the hot He-flash convection zone.
The first network calculations show that due to the large C12 abundance protons
are rather captured by carbon than destroy newly formed Be7 and ultimately Li7.
Moreover, the short evolution time scale has been reproduced by making the
assumption that the convective efficiency for element mixing is smaller by two
to three orders of magnitude than predicted by the mixing-length theory. As a
result the main energy generation from fast convective proton capture will
occur at a larger mass coordinate, closer to the surface and the expansion to
the giant state is accelerated to a few years in agreement with Sakurai's
behavior. This result may represent an independent empirical constraint on the
poorly known efficiency of element mixing in convective zones of the stellar
interior.

for 20 candidate F, G and K stars of the sparse Coma Berenices open cluster.
All the stars are proper-motion selected, and our radial velocities support the
membership credentials of at least 12 of the candidates. Combining our data
with that in the literature, we have a close-to-complete census of Li
abundances for late-type stars with Mv < 5.8. These data show that the
Li-depletion pattern in Coma Ber is similar, but not identical, to that in the
Hyades cluster, which has a similar age but higher metallicity. Several Coma
Ber F stars have suffered significantly more Li depletion than their
counterparts in the Hyades. The G and early-K stars of Coma Ber have undergone
less Li depletion than those of the Hyades, but much more than that predicted
by standard evolutionary models featuring only convective mixing. This provides
strong evidence for additional mixing and Li depletion operating in these stars
during their first 400Myr on the main sequence, amounting to 0.3 dex at 6000K
and rising to 0.8-1.2 dex at 5400K. We find that 4 of the radial-velocity
non-members are among a small number of low-mass stars which were previously
reported as part of an extra-tidal moving group associated with the Coma Ber
cluster. As a result we now find that the luminosity function of this moving
group is indistinguishable from that of the central cluster. It is uncertain
whether there may be a significant number of stars with even lower masses among
the moving group.

the L dwarf companions, ages implied by the presence or absence of lithium are
consistent with ages inferred from the primaries alone.

30-50 Myr old open clusters IC 2602 and IC 2391. These data enlarge and extend
to cooler temperatures previous Li surveys of these clusters by Stauffer et al.
(1989) and Randich et al. (1997). We also give for the first time an estimate
of the metallicity of the two clusters which turns out to be close to solar.
Radial velocity measurements together with Halpha chromospheric emission and
the presence/absence of other spectroscopic features are used to ascertain the
membership status for the sample stars not yet confirmed as cluster members;
rotational velocities have also been determined for all sample stars. Stars
more massive than ~1 Mo in both clusters show no sign of significant Li
depletion, while lower mass stars are all lithium depleted, with the amount of
Li depletion increasing to cooler temperatures. We confirm that the late G and
early K stars in IC 2602 present a star-to-star scatter in Li abundances
similar to, but not as large as the one in the Pleiades. A scatter is also seen
among late-K and M dwarfs. Unlike in the Pleiades and Alpha Per clusters, the
scatter among early-K stars in IC 2602 shows only marginal correlation with
rotation. Our data suggest that the drop-off of lithium towards lower masses
may start at an earlier color in IC 2391 than in IC 2602, but larger cluster
samples are needed to confirm this result. In addition, whereas G and early K
stars in the two clusters are, on average, more Li rich than their counterparts
in the Pleiades, a fraction of the coolest stars, in particular in IC 2391, are
as depleted as as the lowest-Li Pleiades stars of the same mass. If they
continue depleting Li on their way to the main sequence, they are expected to
be more Li depleted than the Pleiades at the age of the latter cluster.

original anisotropies, but will generate strong new anisotropies in the CMB

different wavelengths in this spectral regime can probe different thin slices
of the early universe. The anisotropy noise contributed by continuum radiation

with Teff between 5600 and 6600 K and [Fe/H] from -1.4 to +0.2 based on
high-resolution spectra of 130 stars and a reanalysis of data from Lambert et
al. (1991). The survey takes advantage of improved ways of determining
effective temperature, metallicity, mass and age, offering an opportunity to
investigate the behaviour of Li as a function of these parameters. An
interesting result is the presence of a large gap in the Li-Teff plane, which
distinguishes `Hyades-like, Li-dip' stars from other stars. These Li-dip stars
have a well-defined mass, which decreases with metallicity. Stars above the
gap, when divided into four metallicity groups, may show a correlation between
Li abundance and stellar mass, but with a large dispersion that cannot be
explained by observational errors or differences in metallicity and age, which
ranges from 1.5 to 15 Gyr. This suggests that Li depletion occurs early in
stellar life and that other parameters, e.g. initial rotation velocity and/or
the rate of angular momentum loss, affect the degree of depletion. A comparison
of the distribution of stars in the Li-[Fe/H] plane with evolutionary models of
Romano et al. (1999) suggests that novae are a major source for the Li
production in the Galactic disk.

proportional to oxygen, i.e. is of primary nature. If not, the production mode
is function of the progressive enrichment in O of the interstellar medium, BeB
varies rather as the square of O, i.e. is of secondary nature. In the first
case, fast nuclei enriched into He, C and O injected by supernovae and
accelerated in surrounding superbubbles would explain the primary trend.
  In the second case, the main spallative agent would be the standard galactic
cosmic rays. Calculated nucleosynthetic yields of massive stars, estimates of
the energy cost of production of beryllium nuclei, and above all recent
observations reported in this meeting seem to favor the primary mechanism, at
least in the early Galaxy.

stars to one another and to the predictions of theoretical models including
rotational mixing, and we examine the data for trends with metal abundance. We
find from a KS test that in the absence of any correction for chemical
evolution, the Ryan, Norris, & Beers (1999} sample is fully consistent with
mild rotational mixing induced depletion and, therefore, with an initial
lithium abundance higher than the observed value. Tests for outliers depend
sensitively on the threshold for defining their presence, but we find a
10$--$45% probability that the RNB sample is drawn from the rotationally mixed
models with a 0.2 dex median depletion (with lower probabilities corresponding
to higher depletion factors). When chemical evolution trends (Li/H versus Fe/H)
are treated in the linear plane we find that the dispersion in the RNB sample
is not explained by chemical evolution; the inferred bounds on lithium
depletion from rotational mixing are similar to those derived from models
without chemical evolution. We find that differences in the equivalent width
measurements are primarily responsible for different observational conclusions
concerning the lithium dispersion in halo stars. The standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis predicted lithium abundance which corresponds to the deuterium
abundance inferred from observations of high-redshift, low-metallicity QSO
absorbers requires halo star lithium depletion in an amount consistent with
that from our models of rotational mixing, but inconsistent with no depletion.

  slowly rotating stars II. Lithium Plateau in Halo Stars and Primordial
  Abundance","  The lithium plateau observed in halo stars has long appeared as a paradox in
the general context of the lithium abundance behavior in stellar outer layers.
First, the plateau is flat, second, the lithium abundance dispersion is
extremely small. This seems in contradiction with the large lithium variations
observed in younger stars. It is also difficult to understand theoretically as
lithium nuclei are easily destroyed by nuclear reactions, and subject to
microscopic diffusion which, in the case of halo stars, should also lead to
depletion. Several ideas have been proposed to account for the lithium behavior
in halo stars. The most promising possibilities were rotational-induced mixing,
which could reduce lithium in the same way for all the stars, and mass-loss,
which could oppose the lithium settling. In both cases however, the parameters
should be tightly adjusted to prevent any dispersion in the final results.
Vauclair 1999 (paper I) pointed out that the mu-gradient terms which appear in
the computations of the meridional circulation velocity were not introduced in
previous computations of rotationally-induced mixing. This can lead to a
self-regulating process which reduces the efficiency of the meridional
circulation as well as the microscopic diffusion. Here we present numerical
computations of this process and its influence on the lithium abundance
variations in halo stars. We show that in slowly rotating stars, under some
conditions, lithium can be depleted by a factor of up to two with a dispersion
smaller than 0.1 dex in the middle part of the lithium plateau. We derive a
primordial lithium abundance of 2.5 +/- 0.1, consistent with the recent
determinations of D/H and 4He/H.

turbulence fields is considered in order to explain the lithium decay law
during the spin-down process of solar-type stars. Rotation proves to be highly
effective in the transfer of chemicals through the solar tachocline (beneath
the convection zone) which is assumed to contain only turbulence with
horizontal motions. The effect is so strong that the tachocline turbulence must
not exceed a limit of ~10^-(3...4) of the rms velocity in the convection zone
in order to let the lithium survive after Gigayears. Such long depletion times
can also be explained by a very small rotational influence upon the
eddy-diffusion tensor if it is realized with correlation times shorter than 15
min. It is argued that such slow and/or short-living turbulence beneath the
convection zone could hardly drive the solar dynamo. In our theory the
diffusion remains small for rapid rotation due to the rotational quenching of
the turbulence. In young stellar clusters like Pleiades, there should be a
(positive) correlation between rotation rate and lithium abundance, where the
fastest stars should have maximal lithium. First inspections of the data seem
to confirm this finding.

some of these young stellar kinematic groups. Stars have been selected from
previously established members of stellar kinematic groups based on photometric
and kinematic properties as well as from candidates based on other criteria as
their level of chromospheric activity, rotation rate, lithium abundance.
Precise measurements of proper motions and parallaxes taken from Hipparcos
Catalogue, as well as from Tycho-2 Catalogue, and published radial velocity
measurements are used to calculate the Galactic space motions (U, V, W) and to
apply the Eggen's kinematic criteria in order to determine the membership of
the selected stars to the different groups. Additional criteria using
age-dating methods for late-type stars will be applied in forthcoming papers of
this series. A further study of the list of stars compiled here could lead to a
better understanding of the chromospheric activity and their age evolution as
well as of the star formation history in the solar neighbourhood. In addition,
these stars are also potential search targets for direct imaging detection of
sub-stellar companions.

a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Degenerate twin photons
at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and
coupled into standard telecom fibers. Our PPLN waveguide features a very high
conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6), roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than
that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes,
this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an
important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a
simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed
pump. To investigate the quality of the entangled states, we perform
photon-pair interference experiments, leading to visibilities of 97% for the
case of energy-time entanglement and of 84% for the case of time-bin
entanglement. Although the last figure must still be improved, these tests
demonstrate the high potential of PPLN waveguide based sources to become a key

explosions of C-O cores (""hypernovae,"" HNe) which might be associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We note that the direct impact of C- and O-enriched
hypernova ejecta on the ambient hydrogen and helium leads to spallation
reactions which can produce large amounts of the light nuclides lithium,
beryllium, and boron (LiBeB). Using analytic velocity spectra of the hypernova
ejecta, we calculate the LiBeB yields of different exploding C-O cores
associated with observed hypernovae. The deduced yields are $\sim 10^3$ times
higher than those produced by similar (direct) means in normal Type II
supernovae, and are higher than the commonly used ones arising from shock wave
acceleration induced by Type II supernova (SN) explosions. To avoid
overproduction of these elements in our Galaxy, hypernovae should be rare
events, with $\la 10^{-3}$ hypernovae per supernova, assuming a constant HN/SN
ratio over time. This rate is in good agreement with that of long duration GRBs
if we assume that the gamma-ray emission is focussed with a beaming factor
$\Omega/4\pi \la 10^{-2}$. This encouraging result supports the possible HN-GRB
association. Thus, Galactic LiBeB abundance measurements offer a promising way
to probe the HN rate history and the possible HN-GRB correlation. On the other
hand, if hypernovae are associated to very massive pregalactic stars
(Population III) they would produce a LiBeB pre-enrichment in proto-galactic
gas, which could show up as a plateau in the lowest metallicities of the Be-Fe
relation in halo stars.

dispersion of nine of twelve known young bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs
in the Cha I dark cloud is 2.0 km/s, i.e. significantly smaller than the RV
dispersion of T Tauri stars in Cha I (3.6 km/s) and only slightly larger than
the dispersion of the surrounding molecular gas (1.2 km/s) (Mizuno et al.
1999). This result indicates that the majority of these brown dwarfs are not
ejected with high velocity out of a dense region as proposed by some formation
scenarios for brown dwarfs. The mean RV values are consistent with the objects
being kinematic members of Cha I. The RV dispersion of the T Tauri stars
confined to the Cha I region is based on a compilation of T Tauri stars with
known RVs from the literature plus three T Tauri stars observed with UVES and
unpublished RVs for nine T Tauri stars. Time-resolved spectroscopy revealed RV
variations for five out of nine of the bona fide and candidate brown dwarfs in
Cha I, which could be due to orbiting planets or surface features. Furthermore
we derived rotational velocities vsin(i) and the Lithium 6708 \AA equivalent

OPAL along with a new hydrodynamical mixing process have been considered. We
also introduce up-to-date nuclear reaction rates and explore the impact of
accretion, mixing-length parameter, non-solar distributions among metals and
realistic rotation history. We compare models predictions of lithium depletion
to the $^7Li$ content observations of the Sun and to 4 young clusters of
different metallicities and ages. We show that we can distinguish two phases in
lithium depletion: 1- a rapid nuclear destruction in the T-Tauri phase before
20 Myrs : this is independent of the mass used within our range but largely
dependent on the extension and temperature of the convective zone, 2- a second
phase where the destruction is slow and moderate and which is largely dependent
on the (magneto)hydrodynamic instability located at the base of the convective
zone.
  In terms of composition, we show the interest on considering helium and
especially the mixture of heavy elements : carbon, oxygen, silicium and iron.
We outline the importance of O/Fe ratio. We note a reasonable agreement on
lithium depletion for the two best known cases, the Sun and the Hyades cluster
for solar-like stars. Other clusters suggest that processes which may partly
inhibit the predicted premainsequence depletion cannot be excluded, in
particular for stars below ~ 0.9M Sun. Finally we suggest different research
areas such as initial stellar models and more realistic atmospheres which could
contribute to a better understanding of this early phase of evolution and which

giant component seems to retain more of their original lithium than the
unsynchronized systems. For orbital periods lower than 100 to 250 days,
typically the period of synchronization for this kind of binary systems,

near the main sequence turnoff. The alpha-elements Mg, Ca, Si and Ti are

observed in other metal poor globular clusters, is detected in our sample and
extends to the main sequence. A statistically significant correlation between
Al and Na abundances is observed among the M71 stars in our sample, extending
to Mv = +1.8, fainter than the luminosity of the RGB bump in M5. Lithium is
varying, as expected, and Zr may be varying from star to star as well. M71
appears to have abundance ratios very similar to M5 whose bright giants were
studied by Ivans et al. (2001), but seems to have a smaller amplitude of
star-to-star variations at a given luminosity, as might be expected from its
higher metallicity. The results of our abundance analysis of 25 stars in M71
provide sufficient evidence of abundance variations at unexpectedly low
luminosities to rule out the mixing scenario. Either alone or, even more
powerfully, combined with other recent studies of C and N abundances in M71
stars, the existence of such abundance variations cannot be reproduced within
the context of our current understanding of stellar evolution.

parameters consistent with recent cosmic microwave background (CMB)

the lithium ions recombine into neutral atoms by a redshift $z\sim 400$. The
neutral lithium atoms scatter resonantly the CMB at 6708 \AA and distort its

resulting from the lithium recombination history are calculated for a variety
of cosmological models and found to result primarily in a suppression of the
power spectrum amplitude. Significant modification of the power spectrum occurs
for models which assume a large primordial abundance of lithium. While
detection of the lithium signal might prove difficult, if offers the
possibility of inferring the lithium primordial abundance and is the only probe

LiI 6708 A for a sample of 25 low mass stars and 2 brown dwarfs with confirmed
membership in the pre-main sequence stellar sigma Orionis cluster. Our
observations are intended to investigate the age of the cluster. The spectral
types derived for our target sample are found to be in the range K6-M8.5, which
corresponds to a mass interval of roughly 1.2-0.02 Msun on the basis of
state-of-the-art evolutionary models. Radial velocities (except for one object)
are found to be consistent with membership in the Orion complex. All cluster
members show considerable Halpha emission and LiI in absorption, which is
typical of very young ages. We find that our pseudo-equivalent widths appear
rather dispersed (and intense in the case of Halpha) for objects cooler than
M3.5 spectral class, occurring at the approximate mass where low mass stars are
expected to become fully convective. The least massive brown dwarf in our
sample, SOri 45 (M8.5, ~0.02 Msun), displays variable Halpha emission and a
radial velocity that differs from the cluster mean velocity. Tentative
detection of forbidden lines in emission indicates that this brown dwarf may be
accreting mass from a surrounding disk. We also present recent computations of
LiI curves of growth for low gravities and for the temperature interval (about
4000-2600 K) of our sample. The comparison of our observations to these
computations allows us to infer that no lithium depletion has yet taken place
in sigma Orionis, and that the observed pseudo-equivalent widths are consistent
with a cluster initial lithium abundance close to the cosmic value. Hence, the
upper limit to the sigma Orionis cluster age can be set at 8 Myr, with a most
likely value around 2-4 Myr.

atmospheric abundances of 6Li and 7Li if it takes place after the star has
arrived at the main sequence. Ingestion of planets at an earlier phase will not
affect theses abundances because of extensive pre-main sequence mixing and
burning. We present quantitative estimates of the main sequence evolution of
stellar surface lithium abundances after planet ingestion. At solar
metallicities, for stellar masses in the range ~ 1.3-1.1 M_sun, a large
fraction of the ingested 6Li is likely to be preserved during the whole main
sequence lifetime according to the standard model. Preservation of the less
fragile 7Li isotope occurs in a larger mass range ~ 1.3-0.9 M_sun. At high
metallicities typical of planet host stars, the ranges of masses are slightly
reduced essentially due to the thicker convective zones. Further reduction is
expected if non-standard processes cause extra-mixing of material below the
base of the convective zone, but even in this case there are stellar masses
where both isotopes are significantly preserved. We conclude that there is a
range of stellar effective temperature where migration and accretion of planets
and planetary material can be empirically tested using high-resolution
spectroscopy of the lithium isotopes.

difficult to reconcile with Salpeter-like power-law mass functions (alpha > 2)

turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397 to measure its
lithium content. We conclude that they all have the same lithium abundance
A(Li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. We use this result,
together with Monte Carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowed
intrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. This is a new stringent
constraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict Li depletion. We
argue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recent
models, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. This fact,
together with the good agreement with the Li abundance observed in field stars,
supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. Taking the above
value as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic density
which is either Omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or Omega_b h^2 = 0.005
^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bang

results on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3He and on the estimates
derived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

(Norris et al.). Using VLT-UVES spectra of unprecedented quality, regarding
resolution and S/N ratio, covering a wide wavelength range (from $\lambda =
350$ to 900 nm), we have determined abundances for 21 elements in this star
over a wide range of atomic mass. The major new discovery is an exceptionally
large oxygen enhancement, [O/Fe] $= 1.97\pm0.1$, as measured from the [OI] line
at 630.0 nm. We find an enhancement of [N/Fe] of $2.56\pm 0.2$, and a milder
one of [C/Fe] $= 1.17\pm$0.1, similar to those already reported in the
literature. This implies $Z_{\star}=0.01 Z_{\odot}$. We also find carbon
isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$ =4\pm2.0$ and $^{13}$C/$^{14}$N$ =0.03
^{+0.035}_{-0.015}$, close to the equilibrium value of the CN cycle. Lithium is
not detected. Na is strongly enhanced ([Na/Fe] $= +2.1 \pm 0.2$), while S and K
are not detected. The silicon-burning elements Cr and Mn are underabundant,
while Co and Zn are overabundant ([Zn/Fe]$ = +0.7$). Zn is measured for the
first time in such an extremely metal-poor star. The abundances of the
neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, and Ba are strongly decreasing with the atomic
number of the element: [Sr/Fe] $\approx +0.3$, [Y/Fe] $\approx -0.1$, and
[Ba/Fe] $\approx -0.6$. Among possible progenitors of CS 22949--037, we discuss
the pair-instability supernovae. Such very massive objects indeed produce large
amounts of oxygen, and have been found to be possible sources of primary
nitrogen. Other scenarios are also discussed. A 30-40$M_{\odot}$ supernova,
with fallback, seems the most likely progenitor for CS 22949--037.

  via computer simulations","  We present results of molecular dynamics simulations on lithium metasilicate
over a broad range of temperatures for which the silicate network is frozen in
but the lithium ions can still be equilibrated. The lithium dynamics is studied
via the analysis of different correlation functions. The activation energy for
the lithium mobility agrees very well with experimental data. The correlation
of the dynamics of adjacent ions is weak. At low temperatures the dynamics can
be separated into local vibrational dynamics and hopping events between
adjacent lithium sites. The derivative of the mean square displacement displays
several characteristic time regimes. They can be directly mapped onto
respective frequency regimes for the conductivity. In particular it is possible
to identify time regimes dominated by localized dynamics and long-range
dynamics, respectively. The question of time-temperature superposition is
discussed for the mean square displacement and the incoherent scattering
function.

cluster members including one short period binary system. Combining this survey
with that of Jeffries (1997), we identify a total of 30 solar-type members. We
have used the F and early G stars to spectroscopically estimate
[Fe/H]=-0.096+/-0.081 for NGC 6633 and with more precision that NGC 6633 has
(0.074+/-0.041) dex less iron than the Pleiades and (0.206+/-0.040) dex less
iron than the Hyades. Lithium abundances have been estimated for the NGC 6633

clusters. Several mid F stars in NGC 6633 show strong Li depletion at
approximately the same effective temperature that this phenomenon is seen in
the Hyades. At cooler temperatures the Li abundance patterns in several open
clusters with similar ages (NGC 6633, Hyades, Praesepe and Coma Berenices) are
remarkably similar, despite their differing [Fe/H]. There is however evidence
that the late G and K stars of NGC 6633 have depleted less Li than their Hyades
counterparts. This qualitatively agrees with models for pre-main sequence Li
depletion that feature only convective mixing, but these models cannot
simultaneously explain why these stars have in turn depleted Li by more than 1
dex compared with their ZAMS counterparts in the Pleiades. Two explanations are
put forward. The first is that elemental abundance ratios, particularly [O/Fe],
may have non-solar values in NGC 6633 and would have to be higher than in
either the Hyades or Pleiades. The second is that additional non-convective
mixing, driven by angular momentum loss, causes additional photospheric Li
depletion during the first few hundred Myr of main sequence evolution.

depend on age, mass, and metallicity. This result is consistent with the spread
in lithium abundances among solar-type stars in the solar-age open cluster M67.
Our stars are brighter than the M67 members of similar spectral type, making

UFRs have variable emission. Cross-correlation velocities measured for
ultra-fast rotators (UFRs) are shown to depend on rotation speed and the
filtering used. The radial velocity dispersion of the sample is 17 km/s. A new
double emission line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.55 days has been

suspected spectroscopic binaries, and at least six are visual doubles. The only

  Uncertainties in Input Physics and in Observed Solar Parameters","  Helioseismology provides a powerful tool to explore the deep interior of the
Sun: for example, the adiabatic sound speed can be inferred with an accuracy of
a few parts in 10,000. This has become a serious challenge to theoretical
models of the Sun. Therefore, we have undertaken a self-consistent, systematic
study of sources of uncertainties in the standard solar model, which must be
understood before the helioseismic observations can be used as constraints on
theory. We find that the largest uncertainty in the sound speed in the solar
interior, namely, 3 parts in 1000, arises from uncertainties in the observed
photospheric abundances of the elements; uncertainties of 1 part in 1000 arise
from (1) the 4% uncertainty in the OPAL opacities, (2) the 5% uncertainty in
the basic pp nuclear reaction rate, (3) the 15% uncertainty in the diffusion
constants for the gravitational settling of helium, and (4) the 50%
uncertainties in diffusion constants for the heavier elements. (Other
investigators have shown that similar uncertainties arise from uncertainties in
the interior equation of state and in rotation-induced turbulent mixing.) The
predicted pre-main-sequence solar lithium depletion is a factor of order 20 (an
order of magnitude larger than that predicted by earlier models that neglected
gravitational settling and used older opacities), and is uncertain by a factor
of 2. The predicted neutrino capture rate is uncertain by 30% for the Cl-37
experiment and by 3% for the Ga-71 experiments (not including uncertainties in
the capture cross sections), while the B-8 neutrino flux is uncertain by 30%.

  Temperatures on Ancient Earth and Mars","  The relatively warm temperatures required on early Earth and Mars have been
difficult to account for via warming from greenhouse gases. We tested whether
this problem can be resolved for both Earth and Mars by a young Sun that is
brighter than predicted by the standard solar model. We computed high-precision
solar evolutionary models with slightly increased initial masses of M_i = 1.01
to 1.07 M_sun; for each mass, we considered three different mass loss
scenarios. We then tested whether these models were consistent with the current
high-precision helioseismic observations. The relatively modest mass loss rates
in these models are consistent with observational limits from young stars and
estimates of the past solar wind obtained from lunar rocks, and do not
significantly affect the solar lithium depletion. For appropriate initial
masses, all three mass loss scenarios are capable of yielding a solar flux 3.8
Gyr ago high enough to be consistent with water on ancient Mars. We find that
all of our mass-losing solar models are consistent with the helioseismic
observations. The early solar mass loss of a few percent does indeed leave a
small fingerprint on the Sun's internal structure. However, for helioseismology
to significantly constrain early solar mass loss would require higher accuracy
in the observed solar parameters and input physics, namely, by a factor of
about 3 for the observed solar surface composition, and a factor of 2 for the

  From the Hamburg/ESO Survey. III. The Lead (Pb) Star HE 0024-2523","  We present a detailed abundance analysis, including spectral syntheses, of a
very metal-poor ([Fe/H]= -2.7), peculiar main sequence star, HE0024-2523
detected during the course of the Keck Pilot Program. Radial velocities of this
star were obtained during four different observing runs over a time span of 1.1
years, and demonstrate that it is clearly a short period spectroscopic binary.
An orbital solution was obtained, and orbital parameters were determined with
high precision. The rotational velocity was also measured (vsin i=9.7$\pm$1.5
kms); rotation appears likely to be synchronous with the orbit. The abundance
analysis and spectral syntheses indicate that the object is a CH star
characterized by extreme s-process enrichment, likely due to mass accretion
from an evolved companion which has now probably become a white dwarf. The lead
(Pb) abundance of HE0024-2523 is very high, the same as that of the recently
discovered lead-rich metal-poor star CS 29526-110, [Pb/Fe]=+3.3. The abundance
ratio of the heavy-s to light-s elements, as characterized by Pb and Ba,
[Pb/Ba]=+1.9, is the highest yet found for any metal-poor star, and is about
0.7 dex higher than that of CS29526-110. On the basis of the measured isotopic
ratio of carbon (12C/13C about 6) we argue that the mass donor must have had an
original mass of at least 3 Msun. The unusually short period of this CH star
suggests that it underwent a past common-envelope phase with its evolved
companion. Our results are compared to the latest available models for AGB
yields and s-process nucleosynthesis. We also discuss the possible connection
between HE0024-2523 the lithium depletion of halo stars, and halo blue
straggler formation.

necessary component in any calculation of the evolution of these nuclei in the
Galaxy. Previous calculations of these rates relied on two assumptions relating
to the nuclear physics aspects: the straight-ahead approximation that describes
the distribution of fragment energies and the assumption that the major
contributor to the production rate arises from single-step reactions between
primary cosmic ray projectiles and interstellar medium targets. We examine both
assumptions by using a semi-empirical description for the spall's energy
distribution and by including the reactions that proceed via intermediary
fragments. After relaxing the straight-ahead approximation we find the changes
in the production rates and emerging fluxes are small and do not warrant
rejection of this approximation. In contrast we discover that two-step
reactions can alter the production rate considerably leading to noticeable
increases in the efficiency of producing the LiBeB nuclei. Motivated by this
result we introduce a cascade technique to compute the production rates exactly
and find that the results differ only slightly from those of our two-step
calculations. We thus conclude that terminating the reaction network at the
two-step order is sufficiently accurate for current studies of spallation.

possible systematic errors in the derived Li abundances, the line formation of
LiI lines has been investigated by means of realistic 3D hydrodynamical model
atmospheres of halo stars and 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations. These
are the first detailed 3D non-LTE computations reported employing a multi-level

detailed computations reveal that the LiI population has a strong influence
from the radiation field rather than the local gas temperature, indicating that
the low derived Li abundances found by Asplund et al. (1999) are an artifact of
their assumption of LTE. Relative to 3D LTE, the detailed calculations show
pronounced over-ionization. In terms of abundances the 3D non-LTE values are
within 0.05 dex of the 1D non-LTE results for the particular cases of HD140283

determining the population density of LiI. Although 3D non-LTE can be expected

unburned in an attempt to constrain the cluster age. The lack of a population
of individual lithium-rich objects towards the faint end of our sample places a
very strong lower limit to the cluster age of 35 Myr. However, the detection of
lithium in the averaged spectra of our faintest targets suggests that the
lithium depletion boundary lies at 9.5 < M(I) < 10.0 and that the cluster age
is < 54 Myr. The age of NGC 2547 judged from fitting isochrones to low-mass
pre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams is 20-35 Myr using the

determined by these two techniques is similar to that found in another young

fields in the evolutionary models could reconcile the two age determinations,
but only at the expense of increasing the cluster ages beyond that currently
indicated by the lithium depletion. Alternatively, some mechanism is required
that increases the rate of lithium depletion in young, very low-mass fully

old cluster NGC 6475: our main purpose is to investigate Li evolution during
the early stages of the Main Sequence. We have determined Li abundances for 33
late F to K-type X-ray selected cluster candidates, extending the samples
already available in the literature; for part of the stars we obtained radial
and rotational velocities, allowing us to confirm the membership and to check
for binarity. We also estimated the cluster metallicity which turned out to be
over-solar ([Fe/H]=+0.14 +/-0.06). Our Li analysis evidenced that (i) late
F-type stars (Teff > 6000 K) undergo a very small amount of Li depletion during
the early phases on the ZAMS; (ii) G-type stars (6000 > Teff > 5500 K) instead
do deplete lithium soon after arrival on the ZAMS. Whereas this result is not
new, we show that the time scale for Li depletion in these stars is almost
constant between 100 and 600 Myr; (iii) we confirm that the spread observed in
early K-type stars in younger clusters has converged by 220 Myr. No constraints
can be put on later-type stars. (iv) Finally, we investigate the effect of
metallicity on Li depletion by comparing NGC 6475 with the similar age cluster
M 34, but we show that the issue remains open, given the uncertain metallicity
of the latter cluster. By using the combined NGC 6475 + M 34 sample together
with the Hyades and the Pleiades, we compare quantitatively Li evolution from
the ZAMS to 600 Myr with theoretical predictions of standard models.

Firstly, Li$_6$Sn becomes liquid-like around 250 K, a much lower temperature
than that of Li$_7$ ($\approx$~425 K). Secondly, an additional quasirotational
motion of lithium atoms appears at lower temperatures giving rise to a shoulder

generated by a convective region of the star; this wave treatment of the
classical problem of ``overshooting'' gives extra mixing relative to the
treatment traditionally used in stellar evolutionary codes. The interface
between convectively stable and unstable regions is dynamic and nonspherical,
so that the nonturbulent material is driven into motion, even in the absence of
``penetrative overshoot.'' These motions may be described by the theory of
nonspherical stellar pulsations, and are related to motion measured by
helioseismology. Multi-dimensional numerical simulations of convective flow
show puzzling features which we explain by this simplified physical model.
Gravity waves generated at the interface are dissipated, resulting in slow
circulation and mixing seen outside the formal convection zone. The approach
may be extended to deal with rotation and composition gradients. Tests of this
description in the stellar evolution code TYCHO produce carbon stars on the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB), an isochrone age for the Hyades and three young
clusters with lithium depletion ages from brown dwarfs, and lithium and
beryllium depletion consistent with observations of the Hyades and Pleiades,
all without tuning parameters. The insight into the different contributions of
rotational and hydrodynamic mixing processes could have important implications
for realistic simulation of supernovae and other questions in stellar

days. The resolution of the spectra used was R~18500 and the measured
equivalent width of the line is ~0.34A. It is suggested that the lithium
enrichment is due to hot bottom burning in the intermediate mass AGB variable,
although other possible origins cannot be totally ruled out. In contrast to
lithium-rich AGB stars in the Magellanic clouds, ZrO 5551A, 6474A absorption

classify the S-type stars at low-resolution. Although we identified weak ZrO

  Regime","  We predict near-infrared luminosity functions of young (5 Myr to 1 Gyr) star
clusters by combining evolutionary models of very low-mass ($1 M_J$ to $0.15
M_{\odot}$) dwarfs with empirical bolometric corrections. We identify several
characteristic features in our results. These can be attributed to three
causes: (1) deuterium burning in the most massive substellar objects; (2)
methane absorption in bodies with $T_{eff}$ less than 1300 K, the temperature
of the L/T transition; and (3) the formation of dust clouds and the rainout of
dust at roughly the same effective temperature as methane formation. Accurate
reconstruction of the substellar mass function from luminosity function
observations requires that these phenomena are taken into account. At present,
few observational studies extend to sufficient sensitivities to allow detection
of these effects. However, the luminosity function of the young open cluster IC
2391 shows a clear peak at $M_I \sim 14$ which we attribute to the result of
deuterium burning in substellar objects. The location of this feature is a
strong function of age, and we estimate an age of 35 Myr for IC 2391. This is
significantly younger than the 53 Myr derived from the location of the lithium
depletion boundary but agrees with the main sequence turnoff age. We consider
the implications of this result and our multi-band luminosity functions for
future observational studies. All predicted luminosity function features are,
or will be, accessible to observations using new wide-field IR imagers and the
Space Infrared Telescope Facility.

the measurement of the fluxes of neutrinos generated in CNO cycle, because this
is a direct way to measure with record uncertainty - less than 1% the
contribution to the solar luminosity of a pp-chain of reactions. Combined with
the luminosity constraint method suggested by M. Spiro and D. Vignaud this will
put the foundation for the further substantial progress in the study of

stringent test of the theory of stellar evolution and will complete a
long-standing goal of recording the neutrino spectrum of the Sun. The energy
generated in the Sun and neutrino oscillation parameters are inherently

that probe the positions of single lithium ions at several times. Three-time
correlation functions show that the non-exponential relaxation of the lithium
ions results from both correlated back-and-forth jumps and the existence of
dynamical heterogeneities, i.e., the presence of a broad distribution of jump
rates. A quantitative analysis yields that the contribution of the dynamical
heterogeneities to the non-exponential depopulation of the lithium sites
increases upon cooling. Further, correlated back-and-forth jumps between
neighboring sites are observed for the fast ions of the distribution, but not
for the slow ions and, hence, the back-jump probability depends on the
dynamical state. Four-time correlation functions indicate that an exchange
between fast and slow ions takes place on the timescale of the jumps
themselves, i.e., the dynamical heterogeneities are short-lived. Hence, sites
featuring fast and slow lithium dynamics, respectively, are intimately mixed.
In addition, a backward correlation beyond the first neighbor shell for highly
mobile ions and the presence of long-range dynamical heterogeneities suggest
that fast ion migration occurs along preferential pathways in the glassy
matrix. In the melt, we find no evidence for correlated back-and-forth motions

into stellar evolution models. The approach involves enhancing the metal
content of the surface layers of stellar models. In addition, the surface
layers of stars in the mass range of 0.5-2.0 Solar masses are mixed to an
artificial depth motivated by observations of lithium abundance. The behavior
of polluted stellar evolution models is explored assuming the pollution occurs
after the star has left the fully convective pre main sequence phase. Stellar
models polluted with a few Earth masses of iron are significantly hotter than
stars of the same mass with an equivalent bulk metallicity. Polluted stellar
evolution models can successfully reproduce the metal-rich, parent star tau
Bootis and suggest a slightly lower mass than standard evolution models.
Finally, the possibility that stars in the Hyades open cluster have accreted an
average of 0.5 Earth masses of iron is explored. The results indicate that it
is not possible to rule out stellar pollution on this scale from the scatter of
Hyades stars on a color-magnitude diagram. The small amount of scatter in the
observational data set does rule out pollution on the order of 1.5 Earth masses

  the young, single K2-dwarf PW And","  High resolution echelle spectra of PW And (HD~1405) have been taken during
eight observing runs from 1999 to 2002. The detailed analysis of the spectra
allow us to determine its spectral type (K2V), mean heliocentric radial
velocity (V_hel = -11.15 km/s) rotational velocity (vsin{i} = 22.6 km/s), and
equivalent width of the lithium line 6707.8 AA (EW(LiI) = 273 mAA). The
kinematic (Galactic Velocity (U, V, W)) confirms its membership of the Local
Association moving group, in agreement with the age (30 to 80 Myrs) inferred
from the color magnitude diagram and the lithium equivalent width. Photospheric
activity (presence of cool spots that disturb the profiles of the photospheric
lines) has been detected as changes in the the bisectors of the cross
correlation function (CCF) resulting of cross-correlate the spectra of PW And
with the spectrum of a non active star of similar spectral type. These
variations of the CCF bisectors are related to the variations in the measured
radial velocities and are modulated with a period similar to the photometric
period of the star. At the same time, chromospheric activity has been analyzed,
using the spectral subtraction technique and simultaneous spectroscopic
observations of the H_alpha, H_beta, NaI D_1 and D_2$, HeI D_3, MgI b triplet,
CaII H&K, and CaII infrared triplet lines. A flare was observed during the last
observing run of 2001, showing an enhancement in the observed chromospheric
lines. A less powerful flare was observed on 2002 August 23. The variations of
the chromospheric activity indicators seem to be related to the photospheric
activity. A correlation between radial velocity, changes in the CCF bisectors
and equivalent width of different chromospheric lines is observed with a
different behaviour between epochs 1999, 2001 and 2002.

Lithium depletion depends on the treatment of over-adiabaticity, by taking
advantage of the results of new models by Montalb\'an et al., which apply
different treatments of convection to non-grey PMS models. In order to
reproduce both the PMS lithium depletion (inferred from the lithium depletion
patterns in young open clusters), and the location of PMS tracks in the HR
diagram (inferred from the study of young PMS stars), convection both in the
atmosphere and in a good fraction of the stellar envelope must be highly
inefficient: e.g., in the Mixing Length Theory approximation, it must have a
very low alpha=l/H_p. Unfortunately, the radii of these models are at variance
with the solar radius, possibly indicating t hat there is some additional
physical input, generally not taken into account in the stellar models, which
affects the efficiency of convection in PMS stars, but probably not in the main
sequence stars nor in evolved red giants. We stress the importance of
determining precisely masses and lithium abundance in PMS binaries such as the
important spectroscopic and eclipsing binary RXJ0529.4+0041.

depletion boundary (LDB) technique to the stellar model input physics. The LDB
age technique is limited to open clusters with ages ranging from 20 to 200 Myr.
Effective 1-sig errors in the LDB technique due to uncertain input physics are
roughly 3% at the oldest age increasing to 8% at the youngest age. Bolometric
correction uncertainties add an additional 10 to 6% error to the LDB age
technique for old and young clusters, respectively. Rotation rates matching the
observed fastest rotators in the Pleiades affect LDB ages by less than 2%. The
range of rotation rates in an open cluster are expected to ``smear'' the LDB
location by only 0.02 mag for a Pleiades age cluster increasing to 0.06 mag for
a 20 Myr cluster. Thus, the observational error of locating the LDB (~7-10%)
and the bolometric correction uncertainty currently dominate the error in LDB
ages. For our base case, we formally derive a LDB age of 148 +- 19 Myr for the
Pleiades, where the error includes 8, 3, and 9% contributions from
observational, theoretical, and bolometric correction sources, respectively. A
maximally plausible 0.3 magnitude shift in the I-band bolometric correction to
reconcile main sequence isochrone fits with the observed (V-I) color for the
low mass Pleiades members results in an age of 126 +- 11 Myr, where the error
includes observational and theoretical errors only. Upper main-sequence-fitting
ages that do not include convective core overshoot for the Pleiades (~75 Myr)
are ruled out by the LDB age technique.

such a model provides a very reliable representation of the noninteracting

determine whether or not such a model of 3d electrons moving on the Ti

metal-to-insulator transitions, with the critical concentration defined by the
matching of the mobility edge and the chemical potential. Our analysis leads to
quantitative predictions that are in disagreement with those measured
experimentally. For example, experimentally for the LiAlyTi2-yO4 compound an Al
concentration of y_c approximately 0.33 produces a metal-to-insulator
transition, whereas our analysis of a quantum site percolation model predicts
y_c approximately 0.83. One hypothesis that is consistent with these results is
that since strong correlations are ignored in our quantum site percolation
model, which includes the effects of configurational disorder only, such strong
electronic correlations are both present and important.

We confirm both pre-main sequence status and membership, through the detection
of lithium, presence of narrow potassium indicative of low gravity, and
measurement of radial velocity. The Halpha emission profile is very broad, with
a 10% full width of 316 km/s, implying the presence of ongoing accretion. Our
spectra also exhibit many forbidden emission lines indicative of mass outflow.
Using new 2MASS near-infrared photometry, no significant NIR excess is found.
Our optical veiling measurements yield a mass accretion rate of 10^-10 /
10^{-9} M(sun)/yr. Through comparison with the latest synthetic spectra, we
infer Teff~2700+-100K. Theoretical tracks imply an age of ~20 Myr (as derived
from luminosity) or ~8 Myr (Teff vs. gravity) for LS-RCrA~1. Therefore,
LS-RCrA~1 indeed appears sub-luminous relative to expectations for an R~CrA
member. By comparing its position on the H-R diagram with that of other
similarly accreting low-mass objects, we show that accretion-induced effects
are unlikely to account for its faintness. We suggest instead that LS-RCrA~1
posesses a nearly edge-on disk and its photosphere is seen predominantly in
scattered light, making it appear much fainter (and older) than it really is.
Finally, the surface gravity and Teff estimates, combined with the latest
evolutionary tracks, indicate a mass of ~0.07 or 0.035+-0.010 M(sun) (depending
on the Teff scale).

systematic errors in nuclear cross sections. We critically analyze the cross
section data, producing representations that describe this data and its
uncertainties, taking into account the correlations among data, and explicitly
treating the systematic errors between data sets. Using these updated nuclear
inputs, we compute the new BBN abundance predictions, and quantitatively
examine their concordance with observations. Depending on what deuterium
observations are adopted, one gets the following constraints on the baryon
density: OmegaBh^2=0.0229\pm0.0013 or OmegaBh^2 = 0.0216^{+0.0020}_{-0.0021} at
68% confidence, fixing N_{\nu,eff}=3.0. Concerns over systematics in helium and
lithium observations limit the confidence constraints based on this data
provide. With new nuclear cross section data, light element abundance
observations and the ever increasing resolution of the CMB anisotropy, tighter
constraints can be placed on nuclear and particle astrophysics. ABRIDGED

with accurate {\it Hipparcos} parallaxes. The stars are on circular orbits
about the Galactic centre and, hence, are identified as belonging to the thin
disk.
  This sample is combined with two published surveys to provide a catalogue of
lithium abundances, metallicities ([Fe/H]), masses, and ages for 451 F-G
dwarfs, almost all belonging to the thin disk. The lithium abundances are
compared and contrasted with published lithium abundances for F and G stars in
local open clusters. The field stars span a larger range in [Fe/H] than the
clusters for which [Fe/H] $\simeq 0.0\pm0.2$. The initial (i.e., interstellar)
lithium abundance of the solar neighborhood, as derived from stars for which
astration of lithium is believed to be unimportant, is traced from
$\log\epsilon$(Li) = 2.2 at [Fe/H] = -1 to $\log\epsilon$(Li) = 3.2 at $+0.1$.
This form for the evolution is dependent on the assumption that astration of
lit hium is negligible for the stars defining the relation. An argument is
advanced that this latter assumption may not be entirely correct, and, the
evolution of lithium with [Fe/H] may be flatter than previously supposed. A
sharp Hyades-like Li-dip is not seen among the field stars and appears to be
replaced by a large spread among lithium abundances of stars more massive than
the lower mass limit of the dip. Astration of lithium by stars of masses too
low to participate in the Li-dip is discussed. These stars show little to no
spread in lithium abundance at a given [Fe/H] and mass.

  Here we concentrate on Pop II dwarf stars and we focus in particular on the

internal wave generation is not efficient on the main sequence, and large

zircinate-titanate PbZrxTi1-xO3 (PZT) was used for the piezoelectric phase in
all the structures. The following materials were used for the ferromagnetic

manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM), and lanthanum-calcium manganite La0.7Ca0.3MnO3

through a closed loop containing the sample and an electrometer as the sample
temperature T was slowly varied at the rate 0.1 K/s. Polarized PZT layers
generate a pyroelectric current as the temperature changes. The main indicator
of pyroelectric nature of the current is the sign reversal when the thermal
cycle is switched from heating to cooling. Almost all of the multilayer
structures showed a pyroelectric current, but the pyroelectric coefficient
varied in a wide range. (i) For NFO1-PZT system the coefficient was in the
range 0.01 - 10 nC/(cm2 K), depending on the temperature. (ii) CFO-PZT and
LFO-PZT structures showed a large thermal current and a weak pyroelectric
effect. (iii) Thermal currents, however, were absent in LCM-PZT within the
temperature range from the room temperature to 400 K. (iv) In LSM-PZT, the

diffusion, and gravitational settling for 28 elements, including all those
contributing to OPAL stellar opacities, have been calculated for solar
metallicity stars of 0.5 to 1.4 solar masses. The Sun has been used to
calibrate the models. Isochrones are fitted to the observed color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) of M67 and NGC188, and ages of 3.7 and 6.4 Gyr are respectively
determined. Convective core overshooting is not required to match the turnoff
morphology of either cluster, including the luminosity of the gap in M67,
because central convective cores are larger when diffusive processes are
treated. This is due mainly to the enhanced helium and metal abundances in the
central regions of such models. The observation of solar metallicity open
clusters with ages in the range 4.8--5.7Gyr would further test the calculations
of atomic diffusion in central stellar regions: according to non-diffusive
isochrones, clusters should not have gaps near their main-sequence turnoffs if
they are older than ~4.8Gyr, whereas diffusive isochrones predict that gaps
should persist up to ages of ~5.7Gyr. Surface abundance isochrones are also
calculated. In the case of M67 and NGC188, surface abundance variations are
expected to be small. Abundance differences between stars of very similar Teff
are expected close to the turnoff, especially for elements between P and Ca.
Moreover, in comparison with the results obtained for giants, small generalized
underabundances are expected in main-sequence stars. The lithium to beryllium
ratio is discussed briefly and compared to observations.

straightforward analysis of the ionic trajectories shows that lithium diffusion
results from jumps between sites that are basically unmodified on the time
scale of the lithium ionic relaxation. This allows us a detailed identification
and characterization of the sites. The results indicate that the number of
lithium sites is only slightly bigger than the number of lithium ions so that
the fraction of vacant sites is very limited at every instant. Mapping the
ionic trajectories onto series of jumps between the sites provides direct
access to lithium jump dynamics. For each site, we determine the mean residence
time $\tau_s$ and the probability $p_s^b$ that a jump from this site to another
site is followed by a direct backjump. While a broad distribution $G(\lg
\tau_s)$ shows that different sites feature diverse lithium dynamics, high
values of $p_s^b$ give direct evidence for back-and-forth jumps. We further
study how the local glass structure and the local energy landscape affect
lithium jump dynamics. We observe substantial effects due to the energy
landscape, which are difficult to capture within single-particle approaches.

factors corresponding to a one-component system in the appropriate limits
(pseudobinary system or zero concentration of one component). In particular we
analyze the behavior of the concentration-concentration dynamic structure
factor and longitudinal current, and their corresponding counterparts in the
one-component limit, namely, the self dynamic structure factor and self
longitudinal current. The results for several lithium alloys with different
ordering tendencies are compared with computer simulations data, leading to a
good qualitative agreement, and showing the natural appearance in the model of
the fast sound phenomenon.

  evidence for a young stellar population","  We present a spectroscopic study of D461, a giant star belonging to Draco
dwarf spheroidal galaxy. From spectral synthesis in LTE we derive a lithium
abundance of log e(Li)=3.5+/-0.4 and a C/O ratio between 3 and 5. This is the
first detection of a lithium rich C-star in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Basing
on stellar models of appropriate chemical composition, we show that a similar C
enrichment is compatible with that expectedfor a low mass low metallicity
thermally pulsing AGB star, undergoing few third dredge up episodes. The
position in the log g-log Teff diagram of D461 is also compatible with this
theoretical scenario. In particular, the low effective temperature, lower than
that expected for a low metallicity giant star, is a consequence of the huge
increase of the envelope opacity occurring after the carbon dredge up. The Li
enrichment may be explained if a deep circulation would take place during the
interpulse period, the so called cool bottom process. In spite of the low
resolution of our spectra, we derive a lower limit for the carbon isotopic
ratio, namely 12C/13C>40, and a constraint for the Ba abundance, namely
0.5<[Ba/Fe]< 2. The proposed scenario also fits these further constraints.
Then, we estimate that the mass of D461 ranges between 1.2 and 2 $M_\odot$,
which corresponds to an age ranging between 1 and 3 Gyr. We conclude that this
star is more massive and younger than the typical stellar population of Draco.

colour-magnitude sequence of the intermediate-age (1.7 Gyr) open cluster IC
4651. We find for the cluster a well-defined Fe abundance of [Fe/H]= 0.10 +/-
0.03 (internal errors), with a reddening E(b-y)=0.091. We also derive
abundances for the alpha elements Mg, Si, Ti, and Ca and find a moderate
enhancement of the three former elements. Among the Fe group elements, Cr and
Ni are slightly overabundant ([X/Fe] ~ 0.05). The Na abundance among the giants
is more than 0.2 dex higher than in the dwarfs. We interpret this as due to
dredge-up of 23Na in the giants. Li abundances show a well-defined pattern: the
Solar-type stars have an almost constant Li abundance, just below that of the
Hyades, and the Li-dip is pronounced and well determined. Turnoff stars just
above the dip have a `cosmic' Li abundance, but within a very small range of
magnitudes (0.25 mag) higher on the turnoff, Li drops by more than a factor 10
implying that some extra mixing is required. Among the giants, two probable
clump stars show detectable Li, while all the other (likely) RGB stars do not.
We show that rotating stellar models including the most recent developments for
meridional circulation and turbulence by shear instabilities explain very well
the observed Li pattern. The possibility remains open that the giants
exhibiting the highest Li abundances are actual RGB bump stars which have just
been through the so-called ""lithium flash"".

inadequacies in the atmospheric models) also play a significant role. Lastly,

different spectral regions in the visible part of the spectrum. Some 200
different atomic and molecular spectral lines have been used for abundance
analysis of about 30 elemental species. The wings of strong, pressure-broadened
metal lines were used for determination of stellar surface gravities, which
have been compared with gravities derived from Hipparcos parallaxes and
isochronic masses. Stellar space velocities have been derived from Hipparcos
and Simbad data, and ages and masses were derived with recent isochrones. Only
12 of the stars turned out to be subgiants, i.e. on the ""horizontal"" part of
the evolutionary track between the dwarf- and the giant stages. The abundances
derived for the subgiants correspond closely to those of dwarf stars.

near-infrared photometry from the 2-Micron All Sky Survey. We find that one

accretion and outflow in young stars and brown dwarfs. Our spectra of C41 also
reveal LiI in absorption and allow us to derive a spectral type of M5.5 for it.
Therefore, we propose that C41 is a classical T Tauri object near the
sub-stellar boundary. Thirteen other targets in our sample have continuum
spectra without intrinsic absorption or emission features, and are difficult to
characterize. They may be background giants or foreground field stars not

interstitial lithium donor in silicon. The nature of this effect roots in the
anomalous level structure of the {\em 1s} Li manifold under external stress.
Namely, the coupling between the lowest two states of the opposite parity is
very weak and occurs via intervalley phonon transitions only. We propose to use
these states under the controlled ac and dc stress to process quantum
information. We find an unusual form of the elastic-dipole interaction between
%the electronic transitions in different donors. This interaction scales with
the inter-donor distance $R$ as $R^{-3}$ or $R^{-5}$ for the transitions
between the states of the same or opposite parity, respectively. The long-range
$R^{-3}$ interaction provides a high fidelity mechanism for 2-qubit operations.

are separated in a beam-splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25km. The
wave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,

of crystals is derived starting from the Hartree-Fock approximation. It is
based on the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the self-energy
which is formulated for crystal orbitals (CO-ADC). In this approach, the poles
of the Green's function are determined by solving a suitable Hermitian
eigenvalue problem. The method is not only applicable to the outer valence and
conduction bands, it is also stable for inner valence bands where strong
electron correlations are effective. The key to the proposed scheme is to
evaluate the self-energy in terms of Wannier orbitals before transforming it to
a crystal momentum representation. Exploiting the fact that electron
correlations are mainly local, one can truncate the lattice summations by an
appropriate configuration selection scheme. This yields a flat configuration
space; i.e., its size scales only linearly with the number of atoms per unit
cell for large systems and, under certain conditions, the computational effort
to determine band structures also scales linearly. As a first application of
the new formalism, a lithium fluoride crystal has been chosen. A minimal basis
set description is studied, and a satisfactory agreement with previous
theoretical and experimental results for the fundamental band gap and the width
of the F 2p valence band complex is obtained.

  metal-poor giants. Galactic evolution of the light elements","  We have investigated the poorly-understood origin of nitrogen in the early
Galaxy by determining N abundances in 35 extremely metal-poor halo giants (22
stars have [Fe/H]<-3.0) using the C and O abundances determined in Paper V.
Because any dredge-up of CNO processed material to the surface may complicate
the interpretation of CNO abundances in giants, we have also measured the
surface abundance of lithium. Our sample shows a clear dichotomy between two
groups of stars. The first group shows evidence of C to N conversion through CN
cycling and strong Li dilution, a signature of mixing. The second group shows
no evidence for C to N conversion, and Li is only moderately diluted, and we
conclude that their C and N abundances are very close to those of the gas from
which they formed in the early Galaxy. These ""unmixed"" stars reflect the
abundances in the early Galaxy: the [C/Fe] ratio is constant (about +0.2 dex)
and the [C/Mg] ratio is close to solar at low metallicity, favouring a high C
production by massive zero-metal supernovae. The [N/Fe] and [N/Mg] ratios
scatter widely. The larger values of these ratios define a flat upper plateau
([N/Mg]= 0.0, [N/Fe]= +0.1), which could reflect higher values within a wide
range of yields of zero-metal Sne II. Alternatively, by analogy with the DLA's,
the lower abundances ([N/Mg]= -1.1, [N/Fe]= -0.7) could reflect generally low
yields from the first Sne II, the other stars being N enhanced by winds of
massive Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. At present it cannot be decided
whether primary N is produced primarily in SNe II or in massive AGB stars, or
in both. The stellar N abundances and [N/O] ratios are compatible with those
found in Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems.

  models","  The WMAP determination of the baryon-to-photon ratio implies, through Big
Bang nucleosynthesis, a cosmological Li abundance larger, by a factor of 2 to
3, than the Li abundance plateau observed in the oldest Pop II stars. It is
however inescapable that there be a reduction by a factor of at least 1.6 to
2.0 of the surface Li abundance during the evolution of Pop II field stars with
[Fe/H] < -1.5. That the observed Li be lower than cosmologically produced Li is
expected from stellar evolution models. Since at turnoff most of the Li
abundance reduction is caused by gravitational settling, the presence of
Lithium 6 in some turnoff stars is also understood. Given that the WMAP
implications for Li cosmological abundance and the Li Spite plateau can be
naturally explained by gravitational settling in the presence of weak
turbulence, there appears little need for exotic physics as suggested by some
authors. Instead, there is a need for a better understanding of turbulent
transport in the radiative zones of stars. This requires simulations from first
principles. Rather strict upper limits to turbulent transport are determined
for the Sun and Pop II stars.

a poloidal magnetic field in the solar core. We present here the first MHD
simulations of the solar tachocline which self-consistently include the
meridional circulation. We show that the meridional flow significantly changes
the shape and the characteristics of the tachocline. We find that after the
inclusion of the meridional circulation, a tachocline can be formed even when
the poloidal field lines are crossing the boundary between the radiative zone
and the convection zone. We also discuss the effects of the magnetic Prandtl
number as well as of the magnetic Reynolds number on the properties of the
tachocline. The tachocline is much thinner for higher magnetic Reynolds numbers
and/or lower magnetic Prandtl numbers. We expect that a poloidal magnetic seed
field of around 1 G will be sufficient to produce the tachocline of the Sun.
However, the model requires the initial magnetic field to be in a narrow range
for satisfying tachocline solutions. The simulations including a stable
temperature gradient produce a shallower as well as slower meridional
circulation than the ones without it, as desired from the Lithium abundance at
the solar surface.

  Nucleosynthesis?","  The standard model of primordial nucleosynthesis by the Big Bang as selected
by the WMAP-based estimate of the baryon density ($\Omega_bh^2$) predicts an
abundance of $^7$Li that is a factor of three greater than the generally
reported abundance for stars on the Spite plateau, and an abundance of $^6$Li
that is about a thousand times less than is found for some stars on the
plateau. This review discusses and examines these two discrepancies. They can
likely be resolved without major surgery on the standard model of the Big Bang.
In particular, stars on the Spite plateau may have depleted their surface
lithium abundance over their long lifetime from the WMAP-based predicted
abundances down to presently observed abundances, and synthesis of $^6$Li (and
$^7$Li) via $\alpha + \alpha$ fusion reactions may have occurred in the early

cross-correlation of high resolution (R~6000) AF2/WYFFOS spectra of the gravity

objects of which 54 have sufficient signal-to-noise to detect NaI at an
equivalent width of 3Angstroms, however we only detect NaI in 38 of these. This
implies that very low-mass members of this young group display weaker NaI
absorption than similarly aged objects in the Upper Scorpius OB association. We
develop a technique to assess membership using radial velocities with a range
of uncertainties that does not bias the selection when large uncertainties are
present. The resulting membership probabilities are used to assess the issue of
exclusion in photometric selections, and we find that very few members are
likely to be excluded by such techniques.
  We also assess the level of contamination in the expected pre-main sequence
region of colour-magnitude space brighter than I = 17. We find that
contamination by non-members in the expected PMS region of the colour-magnitude

insufficient to confirm membership, high signal-to-noise observations of the
NaI doublet provide the opportunity to use the strength of NaI absorption in
concert with radial velocities to asses membership down to the lowest masses,
where Lithium absorption no longer distinguishes youth.

small changes in the main frequency. More recent data obtained with the
HIPPARCOS satellite and the Mercator telescope not only confirm the main
period, but also support the presence of a second periodicity of 11 days, which
was also found in the Geneva photometry. A conclusive evolutionary status of

cosmological processes. The primordial Li abundance is guaranteed to be present
and probes big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), while an additional Li component is
likely to have been produced by cosmic rays accelerated in large scale
structure formation. Pre-Galactic Li currently can only be observed in low
metallicity Galactic halo stars, but abundance measurements are plagued with
systematic uncertainties due to modeling of stellar atmospheres and convection.
We propose a new site for measuring pre-Galactic Li: low-metallicity,
high-velocity clouds (HVCs) which are likely to be extragalactic gas accreted
onto the Milky Way, and which already have been found to have deuterium
abundances consistent with primordial. A Li observation in such an HVC would
provide the first extragalactic Li measurement, and could shed new light on the
apparent discrepancy between BBN predictions and halo star Li abundance
determinations. Furthermore, HVC Li could at the same time test for the
presence of non-primordial Li due to cosmic rays. The observability of
elemental and isotopic Li abundances is discussed, and candidate sites
identified.

system as a spectroscopic binary with components of similar luminosity and
temperature (both M3+/-0.5). Based on kinematics, signatures of accretion, and
location on an H-R diagram, we conclude that St 34 is a classical T Tauri star
belonging to the Taurus-Auriga T Association. Surprisingly, however, neither
component of the binary shows LiI 6708 A, absorption, the most universally
accepted criterion for establishing stellar youth. In this uniquely known
instance, the accretion disk appears to have survived longer than the lithium
depletion timescale. We speculate that the long-lived accretion disk is a
consequence of the sub-AU separation companion tidally inhibiting, though not
preventing, circumstellar accretion. Comparisons with pre-main sequence
evolutionary models imply, for each component of St 34, a mass of 0.37+/-0.08
Msun and an isochronal age of 8+/-3 Myr, which is much younger than the
predicted lithium depletion timescale of ~ 25 Myr. Although a distance 38%
closer than that of Taurus-Auriga or a hotter temperature scale could reconcile
this discrepancy at 21-25 Myr, similar discrepancies in other systems and the
implications of an extremely old accreting Taurus-Auriga member suggest instead
a possible problem with evolutionary models. Regardless, the older age implied
by St 34's depleted lithium abundance is the first compelling evidence for a
substantial age spread in this region. Additionally, since St 34's coeval
co-members with early M spectral types would likewise fail the lithium test for
youth, current membership lists may be incomplete.

  Analysis of the UV Absorption","  We present an analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption in the Seyfert 1 galaxy
Mrk 279 based on simultaneous long observations with the Hubble Space Telescope
(41 ks) and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (91 ks). To extract the
line-of-sight covering factors and ionic column densities, we separately fit
two groups of absorption lines: the Lyman series and the CNO lithium-like
doublets. For the CNO doublets we assume that all three ions share the same
covering factors. The fitting method applied here overcomes some limitations of
the traditional method using individual doublet pairs; it allows for the
treatment of more complex, physically realistic scenarios for the
absorption-emission geometry and eliminates systematic errors that we show are
introduced by spectral noise. We derive velocity-dependent solutions based on
two models of geometrical covering -- a single covering factor for all
background emission sources, and separate covering factors for the continuum
and emission lines. Although both models give good statistical fits to the
observed absorption, we favor the model with two covering factors because: (a)
the best-fit covering factors for both emission sources are similar for the
independent Lyman series and CNO doublet fits; (b) the fits are consistent with
full coverage of the continuum source and partial coverage of the emission
lines by the absorbers, as expected from the relative sizes of the nuclear
emission components; and (c) it provides a natural explanation for variability
in the Ly$\alpha$ absorption detected in an earlier epoch. We also explore
physical and geometrical constraints on the outflow from these results.

their monovalency and high conductivity. In these metals ionic pseudopotentials
are weak and the nearly free electron model (NFE) becomes quite accurate at
normal conditions. However, very recent experiments have shown that at high
pressures their electronic properties deviate radically from the NFE model and
even become unexpected good superconductors. In this work we present ab initio
calculations to analyze the deviation from simplicity in a lithium monolayer
(ML) when pressure is applied. We have seen that as a result of the increasing
non-local character of the atomic pseudopotential with increasing pressure, the
surprising half filling Hubbard-type nesting observed in the Fermi line can
explain the interesting complex behavior in lithium ML, induced by its
correlated structural, electronic and even magnetic properties.

first stellar objects that formed in the Universe; elements other than
hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium within these objects were generated by
nucleosynthesis in the very first stars. The relative abundances of elements in
the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because
the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several
models have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of
the giant star HE 0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of
heavy elements known. Here we report the discovery of HE 1327-2326, a subgiant

that of HE 0107-5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and
nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance
patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances of HE 1327-2326,
however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: none predicts the high
Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion mechanism consistent with data
available for the most metal-poor stars.

binaries. We show that no lithium production in these stars is necessary, and
that the abundances can be explained simply due to the tidally locked rotation
of the stars, which lead naturally to slower lithium destruction rates. The
differences in abundances of CVs' secondaries from those of LMXBs had
previously been put forth as evidence that the compact object was related to
the lithium abundance, but this scenario also accounts for the lower lithium
abundances in the secondary stars in cataclysmic variable systems (CVs) than in
low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), since these stars have typically lived much
longer before becoming tidally locked short period systems. We point out that
if this scenario is correct, then the globular cluster X-ray binaries' donor
stars should, as a class, show less lithium enhancement relative to other stars
of the same spectral type in the clusters than the field X-ray binaries' donor
stars show.

this filter produces momentum extraction from the core when it is rotating
faster than the surface. Using only this filtered flux, it is possible to
follow the contribution of internal waves over long (evolutionary) time-scales.
  We then present the evolution of the internal rotation profile using this
formalism for stars which are spun down via magnetic torquing. We show that
waves tend to slow down the core, creating a ""slow"" front that may then
propagate from the core to the surface. Further spin down of the surface leads
to the formation of a new front. Finally we show how this momentum transport
reduces rotational mixing in a 1.2Msun, Z=0.02 model, leading to a surface

the lattice vibration spectrum of the scheelite phase (I41/a, Z=4) was
evaluated using the direct approach, i.e. using force constants calculated from
atomic displacements. The transition volume is in good agreement with
experiment, while the transition pressure is overestimated of 6 GPa. At 20 GPa,
a P21/c structure with apentacoordinated lithium cation is found to be the most
stable phase. This structure is compatible with a transition driven by a Bg
zone-center soft optic mode linked to a soft-acoustic mode along the [11-1]
direction as observed for the proper ferroelastic transition of BiVO4.

this work we present an analysis of the pressure induced Fermi surface

under pressure the Fermi surface becomes highly anisotropic and around 30 GPa
develops an extended nesting, which could be the origin of the complex phase
transitions observed at this pressure via a phonon instability. On the other
hand, the phonon softening induced by the observed distortion and nesting in

severely limits the secure key distribution distance in BB84 QKD systems with
Poissonian photon sources. In attempts to solve this problem,
entanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement
swapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many
technological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can
become practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which
secure keys were generated over >100 km fibre for the first time. We used an
alternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a
Poissonian source. We analysed the security of the DPSK protocol and showed
that it is robust even against hybrid attacks including collective PNS attack
over consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting
(BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a
quantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector
for the 1.5 um band based on frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled
lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD).
The use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to > 1
Mbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the
previous record.

Estimates of the Fermi-surface averaged electron-phonon matrix element and

Gyorffy [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 28} (1972) 801]. The contribution of the lithium

superconducting properties of Li$_2$Pd$_3$B, thus, can be understood from the

tetrahedra decoupled from the backbone of Li atoms, which are connected by
relatively short bonds. Our results suggest that conventional s-wave

of a high angular resolution survey for substellar binaries. Kelu-1 was one of
the first free-floating L dwarfs identified, and the origin of its
overluminosity compared to other similar objects has been a long-standing
question. Our images clearly resolve Kelu-1 into a 0.29'' (5.4 AU) binary, and
a previous non-detection by HST demonstrates that the system is a true physical
pair. Binarity explains the properties of Kelu-1 that were previously noted to
be anomalous compared to other early-L dwarfs. We estimate spectral types of
L1.5-L3 and L3-L4.5 for the two components, giving model-derived masses of
0.05-0.07 Msun and 0.045-0.065 Msun for an estimated age of 0.3-0.8 Gyr. More
distant companions are not detected to a limit of 5-9 Mjup. The presence of
lithium absorption indicates that both components are substellar, but the
weakness of this feature relative to other L dwarfs can be explained if only
Kelu-1B is Li-bearing. Determining whether both or only one of the components
possesses lithium could constrain the age of Kelu-1 (and other Li-bearing L
binaries) with higher precision than is possible for most ultracool field
objects. These results are the first LGS AO observations of brown dwarfs and
demonstrate the potential of this new instrumental capability for substellar
astronomy.

pattern of photospheric abundances, including an order of magnitude enhancement
of lithium and iron-peak elements, but an under-abundance of carbon. As a
consequence of its thin convection zone these anomalies have been attributed to
either radiative diffusion or the accretion of hydrogen-depleted material. By
comparing high resolution VLT/UVES spectra of J37 (and other F stars in NGC
6633) with syntheses of the Be ii doublet region at 3131 Ang, we establish that
J37 also has a Be abundance (A(Be)=3.0+/-0.5) that is at least ten times the
cosmic value. This contradicts radiative diffusion models that produce a Li
over-abundance, as they also predict photospheric Be depletion. Instead, since
Be is a highly refractory element, it supports the notion that J37 is the first
clear example of a star that has accreted volatile-depleted material with a
composition similar to chondritic meteorites, although some diffusion may be
necessary to explain the low C and O abundances.

shows that some stars are lithium overabundant while others are not. The
observed lithium overabundances are interpreted as a clear signature of the
activation of the so-called ``Hot Bottom Burning'' (HBB) process in massive
galactic O-rich AGB stars, as predicted by the models. However, these stars do
not show the zirconium enhancement (taken as a representative for the s-process
element enrichment) associated to the third dredge-up phase following thermal

Galaxy behave differently from those in the Magellanic Clouds, which are both
Li- and s-process-rich (S-type stars). Reasons for this unexpected result are
discussed. We conclude that metallicity is probably the main responsible for
the differences observed and suggest that it may play a more important role

rapidly accreting disks. We find that the type of element synthesis varies
dramatically with the degree of neutrino trapping in the disk and therefore the
accretion rate of the disk. Disks with relatively high accretion rates such as
10 M_solar/s can produce very neutron rich nuclei that are found in the r
process. Disks with more moderate accretion rates can produce copious amounts
of Nickel as well as the light elements such as Lithium and Boron. Disks with
lower accretion rates such as 0.1 M_solar/s produce large amounts of Nickel as
well as some unusual nuclei such as Ti-49, Sc-45, Zn-64, and Mo-92. This wide
array of potential nucleosynthesis products is due to the varying influence of
electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted from the disk on the
neutron-to-proton ratio in the outflow. We use a parameterization for the
outflow and discuss our results in terms of entropy and outflow acceleration.

depletion sets in at hotter temperatures for the higher metallicity stars than
for the low-metal stars. This is the opposite sense of predictions from stellar

However, the dispersion in both cases is large, about 2--4 Gyr. We searched for

branches in strong glasses. Further, we present high resolution Brillouin

during the pre main sequence and main sequence. The evolution is followed using
the CESAM code and taking into account the most recent physics. The effective
temperature ranges from $\approx$ 4700 K to $\approx$ 6400 K and therefore
concerns objects on the so-called Spite plateau and cooler. We find the $^7$Li
pre main sequence depletion is unable to account for the observations in the
halo whatever the effective temperature. This supports microscopic diffusion
and an additional non standard mixing process both acting during the main
sequence. On the contrary the models $^6$Li pre main sequence depletion appears
too strong and is marginally compatible with recent detections.
  During the main sequence we introduce the effects of tachocline diffusion.
This process is a rotationnally induced mixing acting at the top of the
radiative core. We show that the differences in the early rotation history
cannot result in scattered lithium abundances on the Spite plateau. Moreover
the tachocline mixing process predicts $^7$Li abundances in good agreement with
the observations. We briefly address the question of turn off $^7$Li poor
stars. A modest accretion of lithium free matter would be enough to explain
their low abundance in this element.
  We expect the scatter in $^7$Li abundances is correlated to variations in
[Fe/O] ratio for dwarfs cooler than 5500 K. Finally the tachocline mixing is
robust with respect to the recent $^6$Li observations around the turn-off. We
similarly suggest the [Fe/O] should be higher in objects with $^6$Li and
effective temperature below 6000 K.

historically classified as unrelated main sequence stars in the solar
neighborhood, are instead a wide physical binary system and members of the
young beta Pic moving group (BPMG). The BPMG is the nearest (d < 50 pc) of
several groups of young stars with ages around 10 Myr that are kinematically
convergent with the Oph-Sco-Cen Association (OSCA), the nearest OB star
association. Combining SAAO optical photometry, Hobby-Eberly Telescope
high-resolution spectroscopy, Chandra X-ray data, and UCAC2 catalog kinematics,
we confirm with high confidence that the system is indeed extremely young. GJ
3305 itself exhibits very strong magnetic activity but has rapidly depleted
most of its lithium. The 51 Eri/GJ 3305 system is the westernmost known member
of the OSCA, lying 110 pc from the main subgroups. The system is similar to the
BPMG wide binary HD 172555/CD -64d1208 and the HD 104237 quintet, suggesting
that dynamically fragile multiple systems can survive the turbulent
environments of their natal giant molecular cloud complexes, while still being

excellent targets for evolved circumstellar disk and planetary studies, having

  the $^7$Li abundance","  Combined with other CMB experiments, the WMAP survey provides an accurate
estimate of the baryon density of the Universe. In the framework of the
standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), such a baryon density leads to
predictions for the primordial abundances of $^{4}$He and D in good agreement
with observations. However, it also leads to a significant discrepancy between
the predicted and observed primordial abundance of $^{7}$Li. Such a discrepancy
is often termed as 'the lithium problem'. In this paper, we analyze this
problem in the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. It is shown that
an expansion of the Universe slightly slower than in General Relativity before
BBN, but faster during BBN, solves the lithium problem and leads to $^4$He and
D primordial abundances consistent with the observational constraints. This
kind of behavior is obtained in numerous scalar-tensor models, both with and
without a self-interaction potential for the scalar field. In models with a
self-interacting scalar field, the convergence towards General Relativity is

implies a primordial Li7 abundance factor of two to three larger than that
inferred by observations of low--metallicity halo stars. Recent observations of
Li6 in halo stars suggest a pre--galactic origin of this isotope, which is
exceedingly difficult to explain by putative high redshift cosmic ray
populations. We investigate if one or both of these lithium problems may be
solved by late decaying relic particles in the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) coupled to gravity. Assuming that the
gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) we find that in large
parts of the CMSSM parameter space either of these problems can be potentially
solved. In particular, we also find solutions where both lithium problems may
be solved simultaneously. These entail the hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV staus
into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 sec after the Big Bang, as proposed by one of
us before. Moreover, the produced gravitinos naturally contribute a large
fraction, or all, to the by WMAP required dark matter density. A prediction of
this model is the dark matter to be lukewarm with free--streaming lengths of
the order of a 4 keV early freezing--out relic particle. Such lukewarm
gravitino dark matter may have beneficial effects to the formation of galactic
structures and may be constrained by the reionisation history of the Universe.

Several graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) with electron donors, are well

admitted that low dimensionality promotes high superconducting transition
temperatures. Superconductivity is lacking in pristine graphite, but after
charging the graphene planes by intercalation, its electronic properties change
considerably and superconducting behaviour can appear. Li3Ca2C6 is a ternary
GIC, for which the intercalated sheets are very thick and poly-layered (five
lithium layers and two calcium ones). It contains a great amount of metal (five
metallic atoms for six carbon ones). Its critical temperature of 11.15 K is

dependent upon the chemical activity of adsorbate with respect to the B and N

of the B atom, the C atom is energetically favorable to stay on the bridge site
which is perpendicular to the tube-axis, and the Li atom hardly adheres to the
tube (an endothermal reaction). The adsorption behavior of these three types of

In addition, the mechanism of modification of electronic structures of BNNTs by

and Taurus star-forming regions as part of the Cores to Disks (c2d) Spitzer
Legacy project. In addition to the Spitzer data, we have obtained
contemporaneous optical photometry to assist in constructing spectral energy

with low levels of H alpha emission, strong X-ray emission, and lithium
absorption i.e. weak-line T Tauri stars, most of which were undetected in the
mid-to-far IR by the IRAS survey. Weak-line T Tauri stars are potentially
extremely important objects in determining the timescale over which disk
evolution may take place. Our objective is to determine whether these young
stars are diskless or have remnant disks which are below the detection
threshold of previous infrared missions. We find that only 5/83 weak-line T
Tauri stars have detectable excess emission between 3.6 and 70 micron which
would indicate the presence of dust from the inner few tenths of an AU out to
the planet-forming regions a few tens of AU from the star. Of these sources,
two have small excesses at 24 microns consistent with optically thin disks; the
others have optically thick disks already detected by previous IR surveys. All
of the seven classical T Tauri stars show excess emission at 24 and 70 micron,
although their properties vary at the shorter wavelengths. Our initial results
show that disks are rare among young stars selected for their weak H alpha
emission.

  Stars Observations with Predictions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis","  Since the pioneering observations of Spite & Spite in 1982, the constant
lithium abundance of metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.3) halo stars near the turnoff has
been attributed a cosmological origin. Closer analysis revealed that the
observed abundance lies at $\Delta$ Li~0.4 dex below the predictions of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis. The measurements of deuterium abundances on the lines of
sight toward quasars and the recent data from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe independently confirmed this gap. We suggest here that part of
the discrepancy is explained by the first generation of stars that efficiently
depleted lithium. Assuming that the models for lithium evolution in the halo
turnoff stars and $\Delta$ Li estimates are correct, we infer that between 1/3
and 1/2 of the baryonic matter of the early halo (~10^9 Mo) was processed
through Population III stars. This new paradigm proposes a very economical
solution to the lingering difficulty of understanding the properties of the
Spite Plateau and its lack of star-to-star scatter down to [Fe/H]=-2.5. It is
moreover in agreement both with the absence of lithium detection in the most
metal-poor star presently known (HE 1327-2326), and also with new trends of the
Plateau suggesting its low metallicity edge may be reached around [Fe/H]=-2.5.
We discuss the turbulent mixing associated with enhanced supernovae explosions
in the early interstellar medium in this picture. Finally we show that other
chemical properties of the extremely metal-poor stars are in agreement with a
significant Population III processing in the halo, provided these models
include mass-loss and rotationally-induced mixing.

of the solar chemical composition. This may affect the temporal evolution of
the surface abundance of light elements since the extension of the convective
envelope is largely affected by the internal opacity value. We analyse the
influence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convective
envelope of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and thus on PMS lithium depletion.
The surface Li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of several
processes, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paper
thus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. Focusing on PMS evolution,
where the largest amount of Li burning occurs, we computed stellar models for
three selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 Msun, with Z=0.013, Y=0.27, alpha=1.9)
by varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution in
Z. We analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at the
temperatures and densities of interest for Li depletion. Several mixtures were
obtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;
we then calculated the corresponding PMS Li abundance evolution. We found that
a mixture variation does change the Li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,
the Li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavier
than O.

HDFS target QSO J2233-606, based on a high-resolution, high S/N (~25 -- 50)

absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities v ~ -5000 --
-3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines - the lithium-like CNO doublets
and H I Lyman series. We fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all
detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI
relative to C IV and N V) are present at velocities just redward of each
low-ionization absorber. We explore the implications of these results for the
kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.

both $^7$Li and $^6$Li have abundance plateaus with respect to the metallicity.
Abundances of $^7$Li are about a factor three lower than the primordial
abundance predicted by standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN), and $^6$Li
abundances are $\sim 1/20$ of $^7$Li, whereas SBBN predicts negligible amounts
of $^6$Li compared to the detected level. These discrepancies suggest that
$^6$Li has another cosmological or Galactic origin than the SBBN. Furthermore,
it would appear that $^7$Li (and also $^6$Li) has been depleted from its
primordial abundance by some post-BBN processes. In this paper we study the
possibility that the radiative decay of long-lived particles has affected the
cosmological lithium abundances. We calculate the non-thermal nucleosynthesis
associated with the radiative decay and explore the allowed region of the
parameters specifying the properties of long-lived particles. We also impose
constraints from observations of the CMB energy spectrum. We find that
non-thermal nucleosynthesis produces $^6$Li at the level detected in metal poor
halo stars (MPHSs), when the lifetime of the unstable particles is of the order
$\sim 10^8-10^{12}$~s and their initial abundance with respect to that of the
photons is $\sim (10^{-13}-10^{-12}~{\rm GeV})/E_{\gamma 0}$, where $E_{\gamma
0}$ is the emitted photon energy in the radiative decay. We conclude that the
most likely nucleosynthetic scenario involves two different processes. First, a
non-thermal cosmological nucleosynthesis associated with the radiative decay of
unstable particles; and second, the stellar depletion of both of the primordial
lithium isotopic abundances.

the treatment of over-adiabaticity. We present here the PMS evolutionary tracks
computed by using the mixing length theory of convection (MLT) in which the
alpha_MLT=l/H_p parameter calibration is based on 2D--hydrodynamical models
(Ludwig et al. 1999). These MLT--\alpha^2D stellar models and tracks are very
similar to those computed with non--grey ATLAS9 atmospheric boundary conditions
and Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere
and in the interior. The comparison of the new tracks with the location on the
HR diagram of pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as some binary
components are located at too low \teff. Besides, the pre--MS lithium depletion
in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is still much larger than that expected from the
observations of lithium in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
of FST models. Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models should provide a
better convection description than any local model, their introduction is not
sufficient to reconcile theory and observations. Lithium depletion in young
clusters points towards a convection efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases significantly
in FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity down to the value suggested by
Asplund et al.(2004), but the corresponding solar model does not reproduce the
depth of the convective zone as determined by helioseismology.

must be taken to determine the diffusive motion of particles in amorphous
systems based on the bond valence method. The best identification of the
diffusion path is achieved by using a modified valence mismatch in the BV
analysis that takes into account that a Li ion favors equal partial valences to

Kohlrausch function. The mean correlation times show quantitatively that an
increase of the salt concentration results in a strong slowing down of the

apparent activation energy E_a=4.1eV characterizes the temperature dependence

are observed for moderate salt contents. The correlation functions are most
nonexponential for 15:1 PPO-LiClO4, whereas the stretching is reduced for
higher and lower salt concentrations. A similar dependence of the correlation
functions on the evolution time in the presence and in the absence of ions
indicates that addition of salt hardly affects the reorientational mechanism.

the cosmological parameters of the Universe. When the measured density of
baryons (ordinary matter) is combined with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis
calculations, the amounts of hydrogen, helium and lithium produced shortly
after the Big Bang can be predicted with unprecedented precision. The predicted
primordial lithium abundance is a factor of two to three higher than the value
measured in the atmospheres of old stars. With estimated errors of 10 to 25%,
this cosmological lithium discrepancy seriously challenges our understanding of
stellar physics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis or both. Certain modifications to
nucleosynthesis have been proposed, but found experimentally not to be viable.
Diffusion theory, however, predicts atmospheric abundances of stars to vary
with time, which offers a possible explanation of the discrepancy. Here we
report spectroscopic observations of stars in the metalpoor globular cluster
NGC 6397 that reveal trends of atmospheric abundance with evolutionary stage
for various elements. These element-specific trends are reproduced by
stellar-evolution models with diffusion and turbulent mixing. We thus conclude
that diffusion is predominantly responsible for the low apparent stellar
lithium abundance in the atmospheres of old stars by transporting the lithium
deep into the star.

2M1315, a candidate member with a L5 spectral type and measured its H(alpha)

  Scenarios","  If the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and the long-lived
next-to-lightest sparticle (NSP) is the stau, the charged partner of the tau
lepton, it may be metastable and form bound states with several nuclei. These
bound states may affect the cosmological abundances of Li6 and Li7 by enhancing
nuclear rates that would otherwise be strongly suppressed. We consider the
effects of these enhanced rates on the final abundances produced in Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN), including injections of both electromagnetic and
hadronic energy during and after BBN. We calculate the dominant two- and
three-body decays of both neutralino and stau NSPs, and model the
electromagnetic and hadronic decay products using the PYTHIA event generator
and a cascade equation. Generically, the introduction of bound states drives
light element abundances further from their observed values; however, for small
regions of parameter space bound state effects can bring lithium abundances in
particular in better accord with observations. We show that in regions where
the stau is the NSP with a lifetime longer than 10^3-10^4 s, the abundances of
Li6 and Li7 are far in excess of those allowed by observations. For shorter
lifetimes of order 1000 s, we comment on the possibility in minimal
supersymmetric and supergravity models that stau decays could reduce the Li7
abundance from standard BBN values while at the same time enhancing the Li6
abundance.

separation (50-250 AU) from their primaries has raised the question about the
``true isolation'' of planetary-mass objects in clusters. Our goal was to test
the possibility that some free-floating planetary-mass object could in fact be
part of wide planetary systems. We searched in the literature for stellar and
brown-dwarf member candidates of the sigma Orionis cluster at small angular
separations from published candidate planetary-mass objects. We found one
candidate planetary system, SE 70, composed of an X-ray source and a
planetary-mass object, namely S Ori 68, separated by only 4.6 arcsec. In order
to assess the cluster membership of the X-ray source, we obtained
mid-resolution optical spectroscopy using ISIS on the William Herschel
Telescope. We also compiled additional data on the target from available
astronomical catalogues. We have found that SE 70 follows the
spectrophotometric sequence of the cluster and displays spectroscopic features
of youth, such as lithium in absorption and chromospheric Halpha emission. The
radial velocity is consistent with cluster membership. Hence, SE 70 is very
probably a sigma Orionis cluster member. The projected physical separation
between SE 70 and S Ori 68 is 1700+/-300 AU at the distance of the cluster. If
the common proper motion is confirmed in the near future, the system would be
composed of an M5-6 brown dwarf with an estimated mass of ~45 M_Jup and an
L5+/-2 giant planet with an estimated mass of ~5 M_Jup. It would be the widest
and one of the lowest-mass planetary systems known so far.

O-rich AGB stars, for which high resolution optical spectroscopy has been
obtained (R=40,000-50,000). This is done by computing synthetic spectra based
on classical hydrostatic model atmospheres for cool stars using extensive line
lists. The results obtained are discussed in the framework of hot bottom
burning (HBB) and nucleosynthesis models. The complete sample is studied
attending to various observational properties such as the position of the stars
in the IRAS two-colour diagram ([12]-[25] vs [25]-[60]), Galactic distribution,
expansion velocity (derived from the OH maser emission) and period of
variability (when available). We conclude that a considerable fraction of the
sources observed are actually massive AGB stars (M > 3-4 solar masses)
experiencing HBB, as deduced from the strong Li overabundances found. A
comparison of our results with similar studies carried out in the past for the
Magellanic Clouds (MCs) reveals that, in contrast to MC AGB stars, our Galactic
sample does not show any indication of s-process element enrichment. The
differences observed are explained as a consequence of metallicity effects.
Finally, we discuss the results obtained in the framework of stellar evolution
by comparing our results with the data available in the literature for Galactic
post-AGB stars and PNe.

allows one to derive formal uncertainties for fitted parameters, and assess the
likelihood that a good fit has been found. We use the method to derive an age
of 38.5 +3.5/-6.5 Myrs and a true distance modulus of 7.79 +0.11/-0.05 mags
from the V vs V-I diagram of NGC2547 (the uncertainties are 67 percent
confidence limits, and the parameters are insensitive to the assumed binary
fraction). These values are consistent with those previously determined from
low-mass isochronal fitting, and are the first measurements to have
statistically meaningful uncertainties. The age is also consistent with the
lithium depletion age of NGC2547, and the HIPPARCOS distance to the cluster is
consistent with our value.
  The method appears to be quite general and could be applied to any
N-dimensional dataset, with uncertainties in each dimension. However, it is
particularly useful when the data are sparse, in the sense that both the
typical uncertainties for a datapoint and the size of structure in the function
being fitted are small compared with the typical distance between datapoints.
In this case binning the data will lose resolution, whilst the method presented
here preserves it.

the number of known stars of metallicity below [Fe/H]=-3.3 remains quite small
and it would be desirable to discover more, both to clearly understand the
metal-weak tail of Halo metallicity distribution and to clarify the abundance
trends at the lowest metallicities. Most of these extremely rare objects have
been discovered by the wide field objective prism surveys, HK survey and
Hamburg-ESO survey. In the near future the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and its
continuation SEGUE are expected to boost significantly the numbers of known
extremely metal poor stars. We are living exciting times but an even more
exciting future lies ahead !

  and the Stars","  The knowledge of isotopic and elemental abundances of the pristine solar
system material provides a fundamental test of galactic chemical evolution
models, while the composition of the solar photosphere is a reference pattern
to understand stellar abundances. However, spectroscopic or meteoritic
abundance determinations are only possible for an incomplete sample of the 83
elements detected in the solar system. Therefore, only relative abundances are
experimentally determined, with respect to H or to Si for spectroscopic or
meteoritic measurements, respectively. For this reason, the available
compilations of solar abundances are obtained by combining spectroscopic and
meteoritic determinations, a procedure requiring the knowledge of the chemical
modification occurred in the solar photosphere. We provide a method to derive
the mass fractions of all the 83 elements (and their most abundant isotopes) in
the early solar system material and in the present-day solar surface.
Calculations are repeated by adopting the most widely adopted compilations of
solar abundances. Since for a given [Fe/H], the total metallicity depends on
solar (Z/X), a 30% reduction of Z is found when passing from the classical
Anders&Grevesse to the most recent Lodders compilation. Some implications are
discussed, as, in particular, an increase of about 700 Myr of the estimated age
of Globular Clusters. Within the experimental errors, the complete set of
relative solar abundances, as obtained by combining meteoritic and photospheric
measurements, are consistent with the variations implied by the quoted physical
processes. Few deviations can be easily attributed to the decay of long-lived
radioactive isotopes. The huge lithium depletion is only partially explained by
introducing a rotational-induced mixing in the tachocline.

should have been 2-4 times higher than the value measured in low-metallicity
stars. We show that this discrepancy can be explained by the process of
ambipolar diffusion in protostellar clouds, which leads to depletion of
elements with low ionization potential, such as lithium and sodium. In
high-metallicity stars, [Fe/H]>~-1, the depletion of lithium due to this
process is found to be negligible, but for [Fe/H]<~-1.5 the lithium abundance
falls by a factor of ~3, consistent with WMAP observations.

(USA) and Givarlais (France) at 8,182 km between entangled samples. Samples
consisted of doped lithium fluoride TLD's that were simultaneously irradiated
in pairs together at one location by Bremsstrahlung radiation generated by a
Varian CLINAC unit. One of the paired TLD crystals was then mailed to Baton
Rouge and its entangled counterpart remained in Givarlais. The crystal in Baton
Rouge (master) was then subjected to thermal stimulation which elicited a
measurable light emission response in the counterpart (slave) under a
photomultiplier in Givarlais. Highly correlated passive light emissions were
observed in the nonheated slave TLD while the master TLD was ramped up in
temperature and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Maximum
correlations in the slave TLD light emissions were observed at the turn around
temperature which is the point where the master TLD temperature is allowed to
decrease. The experimenter in Girvalais was thus able to determine with high
accuracy the point in time at which the master TLD heating oven was turned off
(turn around point) without any communication between the experimenters during
the heating-cooling phase of the experiment. The implications of these observed

of these two evolutionary phases. Aims. We establish a bona fide set of cluster
members and then analyze this set in terms of binary frequency, projected
rotational velocities, [Fe/H], and lithium abundance. In the wake of the
Hipparcos distance controversy for the Pleiades, we compare the main-sequence
fitting distance modulus to the Hipparcos mean parallax for IC 2391. Results.
The proper-motion survey covers a 6 times larger sky area than the prior
targeted searches for cluster members in IC 2391. A total of 66 stars are
considered bona fide cluster members down to a mass equivalent to 0.5M_sun. A
quarter of them have been newly identified with many in the F2-K5 spectral
range, which is crucial for a main-sequence fit. We find a mean [Fe/H] value of
+0.06+/-0.06, when a solar abundance of log epsilon (Fe)=7.45 is adopted. The
main sequence fitting yields a distance modulus that is 0.19 mag larger than
that derived from Hipparcos parallaxes; thus this offset nearly has the size of
a similar offset found for the Pleiades. The Li abundance pattern is similar to
the earlier findings and is typical for a 40 Myr old open cluster.

significant lithium depletion in the vast majority of cluster members. There is

Determination of lithium abundances in low-mass stars represents an alternative
and robust way to infer stellar ages. Aims: We measured lithium in a sample of
low mass members of the young (4-5 Myr) sigma Ori cluster with the main goal of
investigating its star formation history. Methods: Using the FLAMES
multi-object spectrograph on VLT/UT2, we obtained spectra of 98 candidate

the presence of Halpha emission, and to measure the strength of the Li 670.8 nm

information on X-ray emission, we identified 59 high probability cluster
members. Three of them show severe Li depletion. The nuclear ages inferred for
these highly depleted stars exceed 10-15 Myr; for two of them these values are
in good agreement with the isochronal age, while for the third star the nuclear
age exceeds the isochronal one.

Extrapolation of the model to describe the time dependence of the interacting

$e^{iS}$ ({\it S} is the correlation operator) formalism which, in this paper,
is treated non perturbatively within many-particle correlations. The
application of the derived equations to few-body systems is realized in terms
of Generalized Linearization Approximations (GLA) and via the Cluster
Factorization Theory (CFT). To check the reliability of the model we present
two different applications. In the first we evaluate the transitions energies
in Helium-, Lithium-, Beryllium-, and Boron-like Oxygen. The calculation aims
to a precise determination of the satellite transitions which play an important
role in plasma diagnostics. In a second we investigate a non-perturbative
method to evaluate the charge radii of the Helium and Lithium isotopes by using
the Isotopic Shift theory. We have found that our model leads naturally to
components of $e^--e^+$ pair in the two-electron wave functions of the Helium
isotopes and three-electron wave functions of the Lithium isotopes. The
possible connection of these terms to the QED leading diagrams is postulated.

  Zones","  The questions of how strong magnetic fields can be stored in rotating stellar
radiative zones without being subjected to pinch-type instabilities and how
much radial mixing is produced if the fields are unstable are addressed. Linear
equations are derived for weak disturbances of magnetic and velocity fields
which are global in horizontal dimensions but short--scaled in radius. The
equations are solved to evaluate the stability of toroidal field patterns with
one or two latitudinal belts under the influence of a rigid basic rotation.
Hydrodynamic stability of latitudinal differential rotation is also considered.
The magnetic instability is essentially three--dimensional. It does not exist
in a 2D formulation with strictly horizontal disturbances on decoupled
spherical shells. Only stable (magnetically modified) r-modes are found in this
case. The instability recovers in 3D. The most rapidly growing modes for the
Sun have radial scales smaller than 1 Mm. The finite thermal conductivity makes
a strong destabilizing effect. The marginal field strength for the onset of the
instability in the upper part of the solar radiative zone is about 600 G. The
toroidal field can only slightly exceed this critical value for otherwise the
radial mixing produced by the instability would be too strong to be compatible
with the observed lithium abundance. Also the threshold for hydrodynamic
instability of differential rotation which exists in 2D is lowered in 3D. When
radial displacements are included, the value of 28% for critical shear is
reduced to 21%.

the secondary star of a black-hole binary provides important insights about the
formation of a stellar-mass black-hole. $\alpha$-enhancement might
theoretically also be the result of pollution by the nucleosynthesis occurring
during an outburst, or through spallation by the jet. Aims: We study the
abundances, and their possible variations with time, in the secondary star of
the runaway black-hole binary GRO J1655--40, in order to understand their
origin. Methods: We present a detailed comparison between a Keck spectrum
obtained in 1998 found in the literature, archival VLT-UVES data taken in 2004
and new VLT-UVES spectra obtained early 2006. We carefully determine the
equivalent widths of different $\alpha$-elements (Mg, O, Ti, S and Si) with
their associated uncertainty. We use the well-studied comparison star HD 156098
as well as synthetic spectra to match the spectrum of GRO J1655--40 in order to
determine the abundances of these elements. Results: We see no significant
variations of equivalent widths with time. Our fit using HD 156098 reveals that
there is significant overabundance of oxygen in all our spectra, but no
overabundances of any of the other $\alpha$-elements. Finally, we do not detect
the lithium line at 6707 \AA. Conclusions: We show that there is no detected
pollution in GRO J1655--40 after the burst in 2005. Moreover, we argue that
uncertainties in the equivalent widths were previously underestimated by a
factor of $\sim$3. Consequently, our results challenge the existence of general
overabundances of $\alpha$-elements observed in this galactic black-hole
binary, and thus the accepted interpretation that they are of supernova origin.
The physical cause of the overabundance of oxygen remains unclear.

age is important for understanding of several key questions. It is important,
for example, in establishing the origin of the group and also in comparative
studies of the properties of planetary systems, eventually surrounding some of
the AB Dor group members, with those existing in other groups. For AB Dor two
rather different estimates for its age have been proposed: a first one, of the
order of 50 Myr, by Zuckerman and coworkers from a comparison with
Tucana/Horologium moving group and a second one of about 100-125 Myr by Luhman
and coworkers from color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Using this last value and
the closeness in velocity space of AB Dor and the Pleiades galactic cluster,
Luhman and coworkers suggested coevality for these systems. Because strictly
speaking such a closeness does not still guarantee coevality, here we address
this problem by computing and comparing the full 3D orbits of AB Dor, Pleiades,
alpha Persei and IC 2602. The latter two open clusters have estimated ages of
about 85-90 Myr and 50 Myr. The resulting age 119 $\pm$ 20 Myr is consistent
with AB Dor and Pleiades being coeval. Our solution and the scenario of open
cluster formation proposed by Kroupa and collaborators suggest that the AB Dor
moving group may be identified with the expanding subpopulation (Group I)
present in this scenario. We also discuss other related aspects as iron and
lithium abundances, eventual stellar mass segregation during the formation of
the systems and possible fraction of debris discs in AB Dor group.

relativity, as an apparent effect due to quasilocal gravitational energy
differences that arise in the decoupling of bound systems from the global
expansion of the universe. ""Dark energy"" is recognised as a misidentification
of those aspects of gravitational energy which by virtue of the equivalence
principle cannot be localised, namely gradients in the energy associated with
the expansion of space and spatial curvature variations in an inhomogeneous
universe, as we observe. Gravitational energy differences between observers in
bound systems, such as galaxies, and volume-averaged comoving locations within
voids in freely expanding space can be so large that the time dilation between
the two significantly affects the parameters of any effective homogeneous
isotropic model one fits to the universe. A new approach to cosmological
averaging is presented, which implicitly solves the Sandage-de Vaucouleurs
paradox. When combined with a nonlinear scheme for cosmological evolution with
back-reaction via the Buchert equations, a new observationally viable
quantitative model of the universe is obtained. The expansion age is increased,
allowing more time for structure formation. The baryon density fraction
obtained from primordial nucleosynthesis bounds can be significantly larger,
yet consistent with primordial lithium abundance measurements. The angular
scale of the first Doppler peak in the CMB anisotropy spectrum fits the new
model despite an average negative spatial curvature at late epochs, resolving
the anomaly associated with ellipticity in the CMB anisotropies. A number of
other testable consequences are discussed, with the potential to profoundly
change the whole of theoretical and observational cosmology. [Abridged]

the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like

a new method in which we use instead of $\log g$ the normalized separation
$a/R_\star$ (related to the stellar density), which can be determined directly
from the light curves of transiting planets with much greater precision. With
the $a/R_\star$ value from the light curve analysis of Holman et al.

abundance of lithium, log n(Li) = 2.91 +/- 0.05. These parameters suggests an
age for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This means
that WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host star
for the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit at
comparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their host
stars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planets
have strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet density
is not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environment

  NGC 2516, Hyades, and M67","  Determinations of beryllium abundance in stars, together with lithium,
provide a key tool to investigate the so far poorly understood extra-mixing
processes at work in stellar interiors. We measured Be in three open
clusters,complementing existing Be surveys, and aiming at gathering a more
complete empirical scenario of the evolution of Be as a function of stellar age
and temperature. Specifically, we analyzed VLT/UVES spectra of members of NGC
2516, the Hyades, and M 67 to determine their Be and Li abundances. In the
first two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 K, while the M 67
sample includes stars warmer than 6150 K, as well as two subgiants and two blue
stragglers. We also computed the evolution of Be for a 0.9 Mo star based on
standard evolutionary models. We find different emprical behaviours for stars
in different temperature bins and ages. Stars warmer than 6150 K show Be
depletion and follow a Be vs. Li correlation while Be is undepleted in stars in
the ~6150-5600 K range. NGC 2516 members cooler than 5400 K have not depleted
any Be, but older Hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. Be is
severely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. The results for warm
stars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that
mixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. The same holds for the
two subgiants that have evolved from the ""Li gap"". This mechanism is instead
not the dominant one for solar-type stars. We show that Be depletion of cool
Hyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of the
convective zone. Finally, the different Be content of the two blue stragglers
suggests that they have formed by two different processes (i.e., collisions vs.
binary merging).

sensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they
are likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear

challenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium
niobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for
electro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first
realization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of
lithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved
crystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings
have radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the
electro-optic effect. These results open new perspectives for the use of
lithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical

which are heavily Li depleted. This may be due either to Li production or Li
preservation in these systems. Aims: To measure the lithium isotopic ratio in
the companion star of the neutron star X-ray binary Cen X-4. Method: We use
UVES spectra obtained in years 2000 and 2004 around the orbital quadratures.
The spectra are analysed with spectrum synthesis techniques and the errors
estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: We measure A(Li)=2.87+-0.20

favours Li preservation scenarios, although Li production mechanisms cannot be
ruled out. In the case of preservation, no Li is freshly created in the binary,
but the tidally-locked companion has preserved its original Li by some
mechanism, possibly inhibited destruction due to its fast rotation.

  Metallicity","  The two known ``hyper-metal-poor'' (HMP) stars, HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326,
have extremely high enhancements of the light elements C, N, and O relative to
Fe and appear to represent a statistically significant excess population
relative to the halo metallicity distribution extrapolated from [Fe/H] > -3.
This study weighs the available evidence for and against three hypothetical
origins for these stars: (1) that they formed from gas enriched by a primordial
``faint supernova'', (2) that they formed from gas enriched by core-collapse
supernovae and C-rich gas ejected in rotation-driven winds from massive stars,
and (3) that they formed as the low-mass secondaries in binary systems at Z ~
10^{-5.5} Zsun and acquired their light-element enhancements from an
intermediate-mass companion as it passed through an AGB phase. The observations
interpreted here, especially the depletion of lithium seen in HE1327-2326,
favor the binary mass-transfer hypothesis. If HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326
formed in binary systems, the statistically significant absence of isolated
and/or C-normal stars at similar [Fe/H] implies that low-mass stars could form
at that metallicity, but that masses M ~< 1.4 Msun were disfavored in the IMF.
This result is also explained if the abundance-derived top-heavy IMF for
primordial stars persists to [Fe/H] ~ -5.5. This finding indicates that
low-mass star formation was possible at extremely low metallicity, and that the
typical stellar mass may have had a complex dependence on metallicity rather
than a sharp transition driven solely by gas cooling.

  Bottom Processing?","  Context: The stellar production of the light element lithium is still a
matter of debate.
  Aims: We report the detection of low-mass, Li-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars located in the Galactic bulge.
  Methods: A homogeneous and well-selected sample of low mass, oxygen-rich AGB
stars in the Galactic bulge has been searched for the absorption lines of Li.
Using spectral synthesis techniques, we determine from high resolution UVES/VLT
spectra the Li abundance in four out of 27 sample stars, and an upper limit for
the remaining stars.
  Results: Two stars in our sample have a solar Li abundance or above; these
stars seem to be a novelty, since they do not show any s-element enhancement.
Two more stars have a Li abundance slightly below solar; these stars do show
s-element enhancement in their spectra. Different scenarios which lead to an
increased Li surface abundance in AGB stars are discussed.
  Conclusions: Of the different enrichment scenarios presented, Cool Bottom
Processing (CBP) is the most likely one for the Li-rich objects identified
here. Self-enrichment by Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) seems very unlikely as all
Li-rich stars are below the HBB mass limit. Also, the ingestion of a low mass
companion into the stars' envelope is unlikely because the associated
additional effects are lacking. Mass transfer from a former massive binary
companion is a possible scenario, if the companion produced little s-process
elements. A simple theoretical estimation for the Li abundance due to CBP is
presented and compared to the observed values.

of PTTs using the {\it HIPPARCOS} photometry annex. Two of our PTT stars
exhibit near-IR excesses compared to Kurucz model flux; while recent work
suggests classical T Tauri stars evince similar {\it JHK} excesses presumably
indicative of non-photospheric (disk) emission, our results may be illusory
artifacts of the chosen {\it I}-band normalization. Near-IR excesses we see in
a literature-based sample of PTTs appear to be artifacts of previous spectral
type-based $T_{\rm eff}$ values. Indeed, comparison of the homology of their
observed and model photospheric SED's suggests that photometric temperatures
are more reliable than temperatures based on spectral standards for the cooler
temperature ranges of the stars in this sample. We conclude that our age
oriented analysis is a robust means to select samples of nearby, young,

along the evolutionary sequence of the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397
([Fe/H] = -2), from the main-sequence turnoff point to red giants below the
bump. The spectroscopic stellar parameters, in particular stellar-parameter
differences between groups of stars, are in good agreement with broad-band and
Stroemgren photometry calibrated on the infrared-flux method. The spectroscopic
abundance analysis reveals, for the first time, systematic trends of iron
abundance with evolutionary stage. Iron is found to be 31% less abundant in the
turnoff-point stars than in the red giants. An abundance difference in lithium
is seen between the turnoff-point and warm subgiant stars. The impact of
potential systematic errors on these abundance trends (stellar parameters, the
hydrostatic and LTE approximations) is quantitatively evaluated and found not
to alter our conclusions significantly. Trends for various elements (Li, Mg,
Ca, Ti and Fe) are compared with stellar-structure models including the effects
of atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration. Such models are found to
describe the observed element-specific trends well, if extra (turbulent) mixing
just below the convection zone is introduced. It is concluded that atomic
diffusion and turbulent mixing are largely responsible for the sub-primordial
stellar lithium abundances of warm halo stars. Other consequences of atomic
diffusion in old metal-poor stars are also discussed.

responsible for lithium (Li) depletion during the main sequence. Comparison of
the Li abundances in clusters of different age allows us to understand the
efficiency of the Li destruction process. Our goal is the determination of
membership and Li abundance in a sample of candidate members of the open
cluster NGC 3960 (age ~1 Gyr), with the aim to fill the gap between 0.6 and 2
Gyr in the empirical description of the behavior of the average Li abundance as
a function of the stellar age. We use VLT/FLAMES Giraffe spectra to determine
the radial velocities and thus the membership of a sample of 113
photometrically selected candidate cluster members. From the analysis of the Li
line we derive Li abundances for both cluster members and non-members. 39 stars
have radial velocity consistent with membership, with an expected fraction of
contaminating field stars of about 20%. Li is detected in 29 of the RV members;
we consider these stars as cluster members, while we make the reasonable
assumption that the remaining 10 RV members without Li, are among the
contaminating stars. Li abundances of the stars hotter than about 6000 K are
similar to those of stars in the Hyades, while they are slightly smaller for
cooler stars. This confirms that NGC 3960 is older than the Hyades. The average
Li abundance of stars cooler than about 6000 K indicates that the Li Pop. I
plateau might start already at ~1 Gyr rather than 2 Gyr that is the upper limit
previously derived in the literature. We also find that the fraction of field
stars with high Li abundance (>1.5) is about one third of the whole sample,
which is in agreement with previous estimates. The fraction of contaminating
field stars is consistent with that previously derived by us from photometry.

  boundary-layer solutions","  High-latitude laminar confinement of the Sun's interior magnetic field is
shown to be possible, as originally proposed by Gough and McIntyre (1998) but
contrary to a recent claim by Brun and Zahn (A&A 2006). Mean downwelling as
weak as 2x10^-6cm/s -- gyroscopically pumped by turbulent stresses in the
overlying convection zone and/or tachocline -- can hold the field in
advective-diffusive balance within a confinement layer of thickness scale ~
1.5Mm ~ 0.002 x (solar radius) while transmitting a retrograde torque to the
Ferraro-constrained interior. The confinement layer sits at the base of the
high-latitude tachocline, near the top of the radiative envelope and just above
the `tachopause' marking the top of the helium settling layer. A family of
exact, laminar, frictionless, axisymmetric confinement-layer solutions is
obtained for uniform downwelling in the limit of strong rotation and
stratification. A scale analysis shows that the flow is dynamically stable and
the assumption of laminar flow realistic. The solution remains valid for
downwelling values of the order of 10^-5cm/s but not much larger. This suggests
that the confinement layer may be unable to accept a much larger mass
throughput. Such a restriction would imply an upper limit on possible internal
field strengths, perhaps of the order of hundreds of gauss, and would have
implications also for ventilation and lithium burning.

are expected to produce a cosmological population of structure-formation cosmic
rays (SFCRs). Interactions between SFCRs and ambient baryons will produce
lithium isotopes via \alpha+\alpha \to ^{6,7}Li. This pre-Galactic (but
non-primordial) lithium should contribute to the primordial 7Li measured in
halo stars and must be subtracted in order to arrive to the true observed
primordial lithium abundance. In this paper we point out that the recent halo
star 6Li measurements can be used to place a strong constraint to the level of
such contamination, because the exclusive astrophysical production of 6Li is
from cosmic-ray interactions. We find that the putative 6Li plateau, if due to
pre-Galactic cosmic-ray interactions, implies that SFCR-produced lithium
represents Li_{SFCR}/Li_{plateau}\approx 15% of the observed elemental Li
plateau. Taking the remaining plateau Li to be cosmological 7Li, we find a
revised (and slightly worsened) discrepancy between the Li observations and Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis predictions by a factor of ^7Li_{BBN}/^7Li_{plateau}
\approx 3.7. Moreover, SFCRs would also contribute to the extragalactic
gamma-ray background (EGRB) through neutral pion production. This gamma-ray
production is tightly related to the amount of lithium produced by the same
cosmic rays; the 6Li plateau limits the pre-Galactic (high-redshift) SFCR
contribution to be at the level of I_{\pi_{\gamma}SFCR}/I_{EGRB} < 5% of the
currently observed EGRB.

of manganese carbonate at moderate temperature (MnOx-C). TEM showed that these
materials are not amorphous, but nanostructured, with a prominent spinel
substructure in MnOx-C. These materials intercalate lithium with capacities up
to 200 mAh/g at first cycle (potential window 1.8-4.3 V) and 175 mAh/g at 100th
cycle. Best performances for MnOx-C are obtained with cobalt doping. Potential
electrochemical spectroscopy shows that the initial discharge induces a 2-phase
transformation in MnOx-C phases, but not in MnOx-I ones. EXAFS and XANES
confirm the participation of manganese in the redox process, with variations in
local structure much smaller than in known long-range crystallized manganese
oxides. X-ray absorption spectroscopy also shows that cobalt in MnOx-C is
divalent and does not participate in the electrochemical reaction.

its composition is not known. One hypothesis is that dark matter consists of
massive particles called WIMPs. WIMPs are expected to accumulate and
coannihilate in the cores of stars, but the only signature of this accumulation
has been thought to be hard- to-observe high-energy neutrinos. Here we propose
an entirely new observable signature. WIMP coannihilations in the core of a
very low-mass star, brown dwarf, or planetary-mass object should alter the
star's chemical composition via spallation reactions. Very close to the
Galactic center, these stars may acquire extremely high lithium, beryllium, and
boron abundances, even for models with otherwise- undetectable WIMP-nucleon
cross sections. These abundances should be measurable in certain stellar
systems and phenomena.

  4665","  The so-called lithium depletion boundary (LDB) provides a secure and
independent tool for deriving the ages of young open clusters.In this context,
our goal is to determine membership for a sample of 147 photometrically
selected candidates of the young open cluster IC 4665 and to use confirmed
members to establish an age based on the LDB. Employing the FLAMES multi-object
spectrograph on VLT/UT2, we have obtained intermediate-resolution spectra of
the cluster candidates. The spectra were used to measure radial velocities and
to infer the presence of the Li I 670.8 nm doublet and Halpha emission. We have
identified 39 bona fide cluster members based on radial velocity, Halpha
emission, and Li absorption. The mean radial velocity of IC 4665 is found to be
vrad=-15.95 +/- 1.13 km/s. Confirmed cluster members display a sharp transition
in magnitude between stars with and without lithium, both in the Im vs. Im-z
and in the Ks vs. Im-Ks diagrams.From this boundary, we deduce a cluster age of
27.7^(+4.2)_(-3.5) +/- 1.1 +/- 2 Myr. IC 4665 is the fifth cluster for which an
LDB age has been determined, and it is the youngest cluster among these five.
Thus, the LDB is established from relatively bright stars still in the
contracting pre-main sequence phase. The mass of the boundary is M*=0.24 +/-
0.04 Msun. The LDB age agrees well with the ages derived from isochrone fitting
of both low and high mass, turn-off stars, a result similar to what is found in
the slightly older NGC 2547.

supercritical fields have short radial scales ~1 Mm. Radial mixing produced by
the instability is estimated to conclude that the internal field of the sun can
exceed the critical value of 600 G only marginally. Otherwise, the mixing is
too strong and not compatible with the observed lithium abundance. Analysis of
joint instability of differential rotation and toroidal field leads to the
conclusion that axisymmetric models of the laminar solar tachocline are stable

as part of its AGB evolution. We compare the observed CS 22964-161 abundance
set with nucleosynthesis predictions of AGB stars, and discuss issues of

unusually high lithium abundance (log eps (Li)=+2.1), mild carbon ([C/Fe]=+0.7)
and sodium ([Na/Fe]=+0.6) enhancement, as well as enhancement of both s-process
([Ba/Fe]=+0.8) and r-process ([Eu/Fe]=+0.5) material. The high Li abundance can
be explained by self-enrichment through extra mixing that connects the
convective envelope with the outer regions of the H-burning shell. If so, HKII
17435-00532 is the most metal-poor star in which this short-lived phase of Li
enrichment has been observed. The Na and n-capture enrichment can be explained
by mass transfer from a companion that passed through the thermally-pulsing AGB
phase of evolution with only a small initial enrichment of r-process material
present in the birth cloud. Despite the current non-detection of radial
velocity variations (over ~180 days), it is possible that HKII 17435-00532 is
in a long-period or highly-inclined binary system, similar to other stars with
similar n-capture enrichment patterns.

the average, overmetallic compared to the Sun. The observations also show that,
for cool stars, lithium is more depleted in EHS than in NEHS. The
overmetallicity of EHS may be studied in the framework of two different

  Spectral analysis","  X-ray surveys allow to identify young, main-sequence stars in the solar
neighborhood. Young, stellar samples, selected according to their activity, can
be used to determine the stellar birthrate in the last billion years. The ROSAT
North Ecliptic Pole survey (NEP), with its moderately deep sensitivity (fluxes
~10^(-14) erg cm^(-2) sec^(-1)), is the best survey, to date, able to sample
the intermediate-age (10^8 - 10^9 years) nearby population. The identification
process of NEP X-ray sources resulted in 144 X-ray sources having a normal
stellar counterpart, with an excess of yellow stars with respect to model
predictions. We want to determine if these X-ray active stars are young or
intermediate-age stars, or active binaries. We acquired high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra, to determine the age and physical
properties of the NEP X-ray-detected stellar sources. We measure the (i)
lithium abundance using the Li I 6707.8 angstrom line, which is an excellent,
youth indicator for our age range of interest; (ii) rotational and radial
velocities (through cross-correlation methods); and (iii) chromospheric
emission. The radial velocities distribution is consistent with that of a young
field star population of age 4x10^9 yrs, or younger. Rotational velocity
measurements imply that our sample is dominated by relatively young or
intermediate-age stars, as confirmed by our lithium measurements. Most of the
detected stars probably belong to a young or intermediate-age population. Our
measurements suggest that a burst in the stellar birthrate of a factor of four
occurred in the last 10^8 years. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility
that a small fraction of sources, amongst the fastest of the K-rotators, are
old binary systems with tidally-locked rotation.

Two circular areas, 45 arcmin-radius each, centred on the young massive star
systems Alnilam and Mintaka in the Orion Belt, have been explored. The regions
are very young (less than 10 Ma), have low extinction, and are neighbours to
sigma Orionis (~3 Ma), a young open cluster very rich in brown dwarfs and
planetary-mass objects. We have used Virtual Observatory tools, the
astro-photometric Tycho-2, DENIS and 2MASS catalogues, 10 control fields at
similar galactic latitudes, and X-ray, mid-infrared and spectroscopic data from
the literature. Results: We have compiled exhaustive lists of known young stars
and new candidate members in the Ori OB1b association, and of fore- and
background sources. A total of 136 stars display features of extreme youth,
like early spectral types, lithium in absorption, or mid-infrared flux excess.
Other two young brown dwarf and 289 star candidates have been identified from
an optical/near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram. We list additional 74 known
objects that might belong to the association. This catalogue can serve as an
input for characterisation of the stellar and high-mass substellar populations
in the Orion Belt. Finally, we have investigated the surface densities and
radial distributions of young objects surrounding Alnilam and Mintaka, and
compared them with those in the sigma Orionis cluster. We report a new open

the presence of correlation effects between the cations and anions.
Microscopically, transient ionic aggregates, e.g. {\it ion-pairs}, {\it
ion-triplets} or higher order ionic clusters, engender ionic correlations.
Employing {\it all-atom} simulation of a model polymer electrolyte comprising
of poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium iodide, the ionic correlations are explored
through construction of elementary functions between pairs of the ionic species
that qualitatively explains the spatio-temporal nature of these correlations.
Furthermore, commencing from the exact Einstein-like equation describing the
collective diffusivity of the ions in terms of the average diffusivity of the
ions (i.e. the self terms) and the correlations from distinct pairs of ions,
several phenomenological parameters are introduced to keep track of the
simplification procedure that finally boils down to the recently proposed
phenomenological model by Stolwijk-Obeidi (SO) [N. A. Stolwijk and S. Obeidi,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 125901, 2004]. The approximation parameters, which can be
retrieved from simulations, point to the necessity of additional information in
order to fully describe the correlation effects apart from merely the fraction
of ion-pairs which apparently accounts for the correlations originating from
only the nearest neighbor structural correlations. These parameters are close
to but not exactly unity as assumed in the SO model. Finally, as an application
of the extended SO model one is able to estimate the dynamics of the free and
non-free ions as well as their fractions from the knowledge of the single
particle diffusivities and the collective diffusivity of the ions.

luminescence measurements on two defects chosen as model systems for our
analysis: extrinsic Oxygen Deficient Centers (ODC(II)) in amorphous silica and
F+ 3 centers in crystalline Lithium Fluoride. Measurements evidence that only
defects embedded in the amorphous matrix feature a dependence of the radiative

of the emission band. A theoretical model is developed to link these properties
to the structural disorder typical of amorphous solids. Specifically, the
observations on ODC(II) are interpreted by introducing a gaussian statistical
distribution of the zero phonon line energy position. Comparison with the
results obtained on F+ 3 crystalline defects strongly confirms the validity of
the model. By analyzing experimental data within this frame, we obtain separate
estimations of the homogenous and inhomogeneous contributions to the measured
total linewidth of ODC(II), which results to be mostly inhomogeneous.

material for lithium-ion batteries, with ($x=0.25$, M=Ni, Fe, Co, Mg), to
investigate the effect of doping on the destabilization of the monoclinic
structure relative to the layered rhombohedral structure. A primary motivation
of this work was to determine to what extent the predictions of the
electronically more realistic GGA+U treatment would differ from those obtained
within the GGA. Several significant qualitative changes are found. For the
pristine system in the rhombohedral structure, Mn ions show a high-spin state
within GGA+U, rather than the low spin (metallic) state found in GGA. The doped
rhombohedral structure is unstable within GGA+U, rather than metastable, as in
GGA. In the monoclinic structure, the dopant oxidation states are the same
(trivalent Fe, divalent Co, Ni) in GGA+U and GGA. Co and Ni ions show a higher
spin state in GGA+U than in GGA. The divalent dopants destabilized the
monoclinic structure to a greater extent than trivalent dopants within the
GGA+U, as expected from previous GGA calculations. Overall, our results suggest
that the relatively close agreement sometimes found between properties
calculated within the GGA and GGA+U may be misleading, because the underlying

binary HD 130948BC which together span ~70% of the binary's orbital period. We
determine a total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.002 Msun (114+/-2 Mjup). The flux
ratio is near unity, so both components are unambiguously substellar for any
plausible mass ratio. An independent constraint on the age of the system is
available from the G2V primary HD 130948A. The available indicators suggest an
age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79 Gyr based on
gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is now a unique benchmark among field L
and T dwarfs, with a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. We find that
substellar theoretical models disagree with our observations. Both components
of HD 130948BC appear to be overluminous by a factor of ~2-3x compared to
evolutionary models. The age of the system would have to be notably younger
than the gyro age to ameliorate the luminosity disagreement. However,
regardless of the adopted age, evolutionary and atmospheric models give
inconsistent results, indicating systematic errors in at least one class of
models, possibly both. The masses of HD 130948BC happen to be very near the
theoretical mass limit for lithium burning, and thus measuring the differential
lithium depletion between B and C will provide a uniquely discriminating test
of theoretical models. The potential underestimate of luminosities by
evolutionary models would have wide-ranging implications; therefore, a more
refined age estimate for HD 130948A is critically needed.

with a persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2--3 in 7Li/H. Recent developments
have sharpened all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory
predictions have sharpened due to new nuclear data, particularly the

value shift of ~ +0.04 keV barn. (2) The WMAP 5-year data now yields a cosmic

subset of late-M through L field dwarfs that, because of the presence of
low-gravity features in their spectra, are believed to be unusually young. From
a combined sample of 303 field L dwarfs, we find observationally that
7.6+/-1.6% are younger than 100 Myr. This percentage is in agreement with
theoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. We find
that these young L dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (Dec < 0 deg)
and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, young
associations like Tucana-Horologium, TW Hydrae, beta Pictoris, and AB Doradus.
We use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty
6300-10000 Angstrom spectra of L and T dwarfs taken with the Low-Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory to examine the strength of
the 6708-A Li I line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate the
trends noted by Kirkpatrick et al. (2000). We use our low-gravity spectra to
investigate the strength of the Li I line as a function of age. The data weakly
suggest that for early- to mid-L dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum for
a few 100 Myr, whereas for much older (few Gyr) and much younger (<100 Myr) L
dwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. We show that a weakening of lithium
at lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effect
partially corroborated by existing observational data. Larger samples
containing L dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test this
empirically. If verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited in
Kirkpatrick et al. (2006) that the lithium test should be used with caution
when attempting to confirm the substellar nature of the youngest brown dwarfs.

consider two examples and use a renormalization group technique to evaluate the
ground state phases. The first example is a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs.
We find that increasing the number of interactions in such a two-leg ladder may
result in a richer phase diagram, particularly at half-filling where a few
exotic phases are possible when the number of interactions are large and the
angle of the zigzag is small. In the second example we determine under which
conditions a two-leg ladder at quarter-filling is able to support a
Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase. We show that this is only possible when the
spin interactions across the rungs are ferromagnetic. In both examples we focus

groups found within 100 pc of the Sun: TW Hydrae Association, Eta Chamaeleontis
Cluster, Beta Pictoris Moving Group, Tucanae-Horologium Association and AB
Doradus Moving Group. We determine surface gravities, effective temperatures
and lithium abundances for over 900 spectra through least squares fitting to
model-atmosphere spectra. For each group, we compare the dependence of lithium
abundance on temperature with isochrones from pre-main-sequence evolutionary
tracks to obtain model dependent ages. We find that the Eta Chamaelontis
Cluster and the TW Hydrae Association are the youngest, with ages of 12+/-6 Myr
and 12+/-8 Myr, respectively, followed by the Beta Pictoris Moving Group at
21+/-9 Myr, the Tucanae-Horologium Association at 27+/-11 Myr, and the AB
Doradus Moving Group at an age of at least 45 Myr (where we can only set a
lower limit since the models -- unlike real stars -- do not show much lithium
depletion beyond this age). Here, the ordering is robust, but the precise ages
depend on our choice of both atmospheric and evolutionary models. As a result,
while our ages are consistent with estimates based on Hertzsprung-Russell
isochrone fitting and dynamical expansion, they are not yet more precise. Our
observations do show that with improved models, much stronger constraints
should be feasible: the intrinsic uncertainties, as measured from the scatter
between measurements from different spectra of the same star, are very low:
around 10 K in effective temperature, 0.05 dex in surface gravity, and 0.03 dex
in lithium abundance.

depleted compared to solar-type stars without detected massive planets, a
result recently confirmed by Gonzalez (2008). We investigate whether enhanced
lithium depletion in exoplanet host stars may result from their rotational
history. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow and fast
solar-type rotators from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the age of the Sun and
compare them to the distribution of rotational periods observed for solar-type
stars between 1 Myr and 5 Gyr. We show that slow rotators develop a high degree
of differential rotation between the radiative core and the convective
envelope, while fast rotators evolve with little core-envelope decoupling. We
suggest that strong differential rotation at the base of the convective
envelope is responsible for enhanced lithium depletion in slow rotators. We
conclude that lithium-depleted exoplanet host stars were slow rotators on the
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and argue that slow rotation results from a long
lasting star-disk interaction during the PMS. Altogether, this suggests that
long-lived disks (> 5 Myr) may be a necessary condition for massive planet
formation/migration.

Its metallicity, although being a fundamental parameter, has not been well

young late-type stars in $\sigma$-Orionis. Using the optical and near-infrared
broadband photometry available in the literature we derive the effective
temperatures for these nine cluster stars, which lie in the interval 4300--6500
K (1--3 \Msuno). These parameters are employed to compute a grid of synthetic
spectra based on the code MOOG and Kurucz model atmospheres. We employ a
$\chi^2$-minimization procedure to derive the stellar surface gravity and
atmospheric abundances of Al, Ca, Si, Fe, Ni and Li, using multi-object optical
spectroscopy taken with WYFFOS+AF2 at at the William Herschel Telescope
($\lambda/\delta\lambda\sim7500$). The average metallicity of the
$\sigma$-Orionis cluster is [Fe/H] $ = -0.02\pm0.09\pm0.13$ (random and
systematic errors). The abundances of the other elements, except lithium, seem
to be consistent with solar values. Lithium abundances are in agreement with
the ""cosmic"" $^7$Li abundance, except for two stars which show a $\log
\epsilon(\mathrm{Li})$ in the range 3.6--3.7 (although almost consistent within
the error bars). There are also other two stars with $\log

$\sigma$-Orionis cluster of $28\pm4$km/s. The $\sigma$-Orionis metallicity is
roughly solar.

based on high-resolution spectra obtained with FOCES@CAHA (Spain) and SARG@TNG
(Spain) and contemporaneous photometry performed at Catania (Italy) and Ege
(Turkey) observatories. The main aim is to investigate the topology of magnetic
active regions at photospheric and chromospheric levels in young single stars.
Since our targets are slow rotators (vsini < 25 km/s), corresponding to
rotation periods larger than about 2 days, we are able to apply the
spectroscopic technique based on line-depth ratio for the measure of the
photospheric temperature modulation. These stars, possible members of Stellar
Kinematic Groups, display emission cores in the CaII H&K and IRT lines, as well
as a conspicuous filling-in of the Halpha core. Moreover, we detect absorption
of the HeI-D3 line, coming from the upper chromospheric layers, derive the
lithium abundance (age indicator), and measure the rotational and radial
velocities. We find a clear rotational modulation, due to photospheric spots,
both in the light and the temperature curves. The Halpha and the CaII-IRT
emissions display a fair variation correlated with the rotation. Finally, we
are developing a spot/plage model to reproduce the data and derive the spot
parameters (namely, filling factor and temperature) and to recover information
about the chromospheric inhomogeneities (flux contrast and filling factor).
This study is very important to explore the correlations between global stellar
parameters (e.g., surface gravity, effective temperature) and spot/plage
characteristics in stars with different activity level and evolutionary stage.

  6Li","  Two problems are discussed here. The first one is the 0.4 dex discrepancy
between the 7Li abundance derived from the spectra of metal-poor halo stars on
the one hand, and from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, based on the cosmological
parameters constrained by the WMAP measurements, on the other hand. Lithium,
indeed, can be depleted in the convection zone of unevolved stars. The
understanding of the hydrodynamics of the crucial zone near the bottom of the
convective envelope in dwarfs or turn-off stars of solar metallicity has
recently made enormous progress with the inclusion of internal gravity waves.
However, similar work for metal-poor stars is still lacking. Therefore it is
not yet clear whether the depletion occurring in the metal-poor stars
themselves is adequate to produce a 7Li plateau. The second problem pertains to
the large amount of 6Li recently found in metal-poor halo stars. The
convection-related asymmetry of the 7Li line could mimic the signal attributed
so far to the weak blend of 6Li in the red wing of the 7Li line. Theoretical
computations show that the signal generated by the asymmetry of 7Li is 2.0,
2.1, and 3.7 per cent for [Fe/H]= -3.0, -2.0, -1.0, respectively (Teff =6250 K
and log g=4.0 [cgs]). In addition we re-investigate the statistical properties
of the 6Li plateau and show that previous analyses were biased. Our conclusion
is that the 6Li plateau can be reinterpreted in terms of intrinsic line
asymmetry, without the need to invoke a contribution of 6Li. (abridged)

Vel. Several hundred PMS stars are identified and the youth of a subset of
these is confirmed by the presence of lithium, H-alpha emission and X-ray
activity. We show that the PMS stars are kinematically coherent and spatially
concentrated around gamma Vel. The PMS stars have similar proper motions to
gamma Vel, to main-sequence stars around gammaVel and to early-type stars of
the wider Vela OB2 association of which gamma^2 Vel is the brightest member.
The ratio of main-sequence stars to low-mass (0.1-0.6 Msun) PMS stars is
consistent with a Kroupa mass function. Main-sequence fitting to stars around
gamma Vel gives a distance modulus of 7.76+/-0.07 mag, consistent with a
similarly-determined distance for Vela OB2 and with interferometric distances
to gamma^2 Vel. High-mass stellar models indicate an age of 3-4 Myr for gamma^2
Vel, but the low-mass PMS stars have ages of ~10 Myr according to low-mass
evolutionary models and 5-10 Myr by empirically placing them in an age sequence
with other clusters based on colour-magnitude diagrams and lithium depletion.
We conclude that the low-mass PMS stars form a genuine association with gamma
Vel and that this is a subcluster within the larger Vela OB2 association. We
speculate that gamma^2 Vel formed after the low-mass stars, expelling gas,
terminating star formation and unbinding the association. The velocity
dispersion of the PMS stars is too low for this star forming event to have
produced all the stars in Vela OB2. Instead, star formation must have started
at several sites within a molecular cloud, either sequentially or,
simultaneously after some triggering event [abridged].

through hadronic decays of a massive metastable particle which alter the
primordial element abundances. We explore this possibility using gravitino dark
matter framework in which the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is
typically long-lived. We found that stop NLSP can provide an attractive
solution to the lithium problem.

  LTE","  The discovery of the Spite plateau in the abundances of 7Li for metal-poor
stars led to the determination of an observationally deduced primordial lithium
abundance. However, after the success of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) in determining the baryon density, OmegaBh^2, there was a
discrepancy between observationally determined and theoretically determined
abundances in the case of 7Li. One of the most important uncertain factors in
the calculation of the stellar 7Li abundance is the effective temperature,
Teff. We use sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs to calculate new Teff values using
the excitation energy method. With this temperature scale we then calculate new
Li abundances for this group of stars in an attempt to resolve the 7Li
discrepancy. Using high signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 100) spectra of 16 metal-poor
halo dwarfs, obtained with the UCLES spectrograph on the AAT, measurements of
equivalent widths from a set of unblended FeI lines are made. These equivalent
widths are then used to calculate new Teff values with the use of the single
line radiative transfer program WIDTH6, where we have constrained the gravity
using either theoretical isochrones or the Hipparcos parallax, rather than the
ionization balance. The lithium abundances of the stars are calculated with
these temperatures. The physical parameters are derived for the 16 programme
stars, and two standards. These include Teff, log g, [Fe/H], microturbulence
and 7Li abundances. A comparison between the temperature scale of this work and
those adopted by others has been undertaken. We find good consistency with the
temperatures derived from the Halpha line by Asplund et al. (2006), but not
with the hotter scale of Melendez & Ramirez (2004).

EHS are, on the average, overmetallic compared to the Sun. The observations
also show that, for cool stars, lithium is more depleted in EHS than in NEHS.
The aim of this paper is to obtain constraints on possible models able to
explain this difference, in the framework of overmetallic models compared to
models with solar abundances. Methods. We have computed main sequence stellar
models with various masses and metallicities. The results show different
behaviour for the lithium destruction according to those parameters. We compare
these results to the spectroscopic observations of lithium. Results. Our models
show that the observed lithium differences between EHS and NEHS are not
directly due to the overmetallicity of the EHS: some extra mixing is needed
below the convective zones. We discuss possible explanations for the needed
extra mixing, in particular an increase of the mixing efficiency associated
with the development of shear instabilities below the convective zone,
triggered by angular momentum transfer due to the planetary migration.

zero-energy resonances where the trimer dissociates into three free atoms. Our

metal-poor (CEMP) stars, under the assumption that such stars are formed by
mass transfer in a binary system. We have modelled the accretion of material
ejected by an asymptotic giant branch star on to the surface of a companion
star. We then examine three different scenarios: one in which the material is
mixed only by convective processes, one in which thermohaline mixing is present
and a third in which both thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling are
taken in to account. The results of these runs are compared to light element
abundance measurements in CEMP stars (primarily CEMP-s stars, which are rich in
$s$-processes elements and likely to have formed by mass transfer from an AGB
star), focusing on the elements Li, F, Na and Mg. None of the elements is able
to provide a conclusive picture of the extent of mixing of accreted material.
We confirm that lithium can only be preserved if little mixing takes place. The
bulk of the sodium observations suggest that accreted material is effectively
mixed but there are also several highly Na and Mg-rich objects that can only be
explained if the accreted material is unmixed. We suggest that the available
sodium data may hint that extra mixing is taking place on the giant branch,
though we caution that the data is sparse.

nonaxisymmetric disturbances if it is true that no cos^{4}\theta term exists in
its rotation law. We also show that the toroidal field of 200 Gauss amplitude
which produces the tachocline in the magnetic theory of Ruediger & Kitchatinov
(1997) is stable against nonaxisymmetric MHD disturbances -- but it becomes
unstable for rotation periods slightly slower than 25 days. The instability of
such weak fields lives from the high thermal diffusivity of stellar radiation
zones compared with the magnetic diffusivity. The growth times, however, result
as very long (of order of 10\^5 rotation times). With estimations of the
chemical mixing we find the maximal possible field amplitude to be ~500 Gauss
in order to explain the observed lithium abundance of the Sun. Dynamos with
such low field amplitudes should not be relevant for the solar activity cycle.
With nonlinear simulations of MHD Taylor-Couette flows it is shown that for the
rotation-dominated magnetic instability the resulting eddy viscosity is only of
the order of the molecular viscosity. The Schmidt number as the ratio of
viscosity and chemical diffusion grows to values of ~20. For the majority of
the stellar physics applications, the magnetic-dominated Tayler instability
will be quenched by the stellar rotation.

orbits have been obtained by measuring the radial velocities of the cool
component absorption lines and the broad Halpha emission wings, which seem to
be associated with the hot component. A set of cF-type absorption lines were
also analyzed for a possible connection with the hot component motion. A new
period of 453.6 days and a mass ratio, q=M_g/M_h=0.59 were determined. Assuming
a massive white dwarf as the hot component, M_h= 1.2-1.4 M_{\odot}, the red
giant mass is M_g= 0.68-0.80 M_{\odot} and the orbit inclination, i =
49-52^{\circ}. The cF-type lines are not associated with either binary
component, and are most likely formed in the material streaming towards the hot
component. We also confirm the presence of the LiI doublet in RS Oph and its
radial velocities fit very well the M-giant radial velocity curve. Regardless
of the mechanism involved to produce lithium, its origin is most likely from
within the cool giant rather than material captured by the giant at the time of
the nova explosion. In April 2006 most of the emission lines present a broad

stellar mass. Using FLAMES/Giraffe on the VLT, we obtained spectra of 157
candidate members of the old, metal-poor cluster Berkeley 32, to determine
membership and to study the Li behavior of confirmed members. Radial velocities
were measured, allowing us to derive both the cluster velocity and membership
information for the sample stars. The Li abundances were obtained from the
equivalent width of the Li I 670.8 nm feature, using curves of growth.We
obtained an average radial velocity of 105.2 +/- 0.86 km/s; 53 % of the stars
are confirmed as members.The Li - effective temperature distribution of
unevolved members matches the upper envelope of M 67, as well as that of the
slightly older and more metal-rich NGC 188.No major dispersion in Li is
detected. When considering the Li distribution as a function of mass, however,
Be 32 members with solar-like temperature are less massive and less Li-depleted
than their counterparts in the other clusters. The mean Li of stars in the
temperature interval 5750 < Teff < 6050 K is log n(Li)=2.47 +/- 0.16, less than
a factor of two below the average Li of the 600 Myr old Hyades, and slightly
above the average of intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) clusters, the upper envelope of
M67, and NGC 188. This value is comparable to or slightly higher than the
plateau of Pop. II stars. The similarity of the average Li abundance of
clusters of different age and metallicity, along with its closeness to the halo
dwarf plateau, is very intriguing and suggests that, whatever the initial Li
abundance and the Li depletion histories, old stars converge to almost the same
final Li abundance.

explore the likely range of stellar parameters (T_eff and log g) for the
hyper-metal-poor (HMP) star HE 1327-2326. Combining the constraints from Balmer
line profiles and the Ca I/II ionization equilibrium, a subgiant stage of
evolution is indicated. This result is further supported by spectrophotometric
observations of the Balmer jump. If a higher T_eff value was used (as favoured
by some photometric calibrations), the spectroscopic analysis would indicate a
turnoff-point stage of evolution. Using a stellar-structure code that treats
the effects of atomic diffusion throughout the star in detail, we evolve a
low-mass model star to reach the HR-diagram position of HE 1327-2326 after
roughly 13 Gyr. While the surface abundances are modified significantly (by
more than 1 dex for the case of uninhibited diffusion), such corrections can
not resolve the discrepancy between the abundance inferred from the
non-detection of the Li I resonance line at 6707 Angstroem and the WMAP-based
primordial lithium abundance. As there are numerous processes that can destroy
lithium, any cosmological interpretation of a lower-than-expected lithium
abundance at the lowest metallicities will have to await sample sizes of
unevolved hyper-metal-poor stars that are one order of magnitude larger. The
situation remains equally inconclusive concerning atomic-diffusion corrections.
Here, attempts have to be made to better constrain internal mixing processes,
both observationally and by means of sophisticated modelling. With constraints
on additional mixing processes taken from a recent globular-cluster study, the
likeliest scenario is that HE 1327-2326's surface abundances have undergone
mild depletion (of order 0.2 dex).

  groups: the case of the Local Association","  The associations and moving groups of young stars are excellent laboratories
for investigating stellar formation in the solar neighborhood. Previous results
have confirmed that a non-negligible fraction of old main-sequence stars is
present in the lists of possible members of young stellar kinematic groups. A
detailed study of the properties of these samples is needed to separate the
young stars from old main-sequence stars with similar space motion, and
identify the origin of these structures. We used stars possible members of the
young (~ 10 - 650 Myr) moving groups from the literature. To determine the age
of the stars, we used several suitable age indicators for young main sequence
stars, i.e., X-ray fluxes and other photometric data. We also used
spectroscopic data, in particular the equivalent width of the lithium line Li I
and Halpha, to constrain the range of ages of the stars. By combining
photometric and spectroscopic data, we were able to separate the young stars
(10 - 650 Myr) from the old (> 1 Gyr) field ones. We found, in particular, that
the Local Association is contaminated by old field stars at the level of ~30%.
This value must be considered as the contamination for our particular sample,
and not of the entire Local Association. For other young moving groups, it is
more difficult to estimate the fraction of old stars among possible members.
However, the level of X-ray emission can, at least, help to separate two age
populations: stars with <200 Myr and stars older than this. Our results are
consistent with a scenario in which the moving groups contain both groups of
young stars formed in a recent star-formation episode and old field stars with
similar space motion. Only by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic data is
it possible to distinguish between these two age populations.

stars. We investigate the effects of interaction between tides and rotation on
the stellar structure and evolution. The Kippenhahn & Thomas (1970)
approximation, along with the Clairaut-Legendre expansion for the gravitational
potential of a self-gravitating body, is used to take the distortion effects
into account. We obtained values of internal structure constants for low-mass,
pre-main sequence stars from stellar evolutionary models that consider the
combined effects of rotation and tidal forces due to a companion star. We also
derived a new expression for the rotational inertia of a tidally and
rotationally distorted star. Our distorted models were successfully used to
analyze the eclipsing binary system EK Cep, reproducing the stellar radii,
effective temperature ratio, lithium depletion, rotational velocities, and the
apsidal motion rate in the age interval of 15.5-16.7 Myr. In the low-mass
range, the assumption that harmonics greater than j=2 can be neglected seems
not to be fully justified, although it is widely used when analyzing the
apsidal motion of binary systems. The non-standard evolutionary tracks are
cooler than the standard ones, mainly for low-mass stars. Distorted models
predict more mass-concentrated stars at the zero-age main-sequence than
standard models.

the combined observational constraints of the total mass and individual

would uniquely test substellar models. We estimate a spectral type of L7+/-1

determination. This enables a precise estimate of its effective temperature
from Tucson (Lyon) models of 1460+/-40 K (1440+/-40 K), which is 200 K higher
than estimates for young late-L companions but consistent with older late-L
field dwarfs, supporting the idea that the temperature of the L/T transition is
surface gravity dependent. Comparing our temperature estimate for LHS 2397aB to
those derived from spectral synthesis modeling for similar objects reveals
consistency between evolutionary and atmospheric models at the L/T transition,
despite the currently limited understanding of this phase of substellar

spectroscopic binaries (SBs) from the sample, which have strong X-ray emission
due to tidal spin-up rather than youth. This is equivalent to a 16%
spectroscopic binary fraction, with at most a handful of undiscovered SBs. We
estimate upper limits on the age of the remaining M dwarfs using spectroscopic
youth indicators such as surface gravity-sensitive indices (CaH and K I). We
find that for a sample of field stars with no metallicity measurements, a
single CaH gravity index may not be sufficient, as higher metallicities mimic
lower gravity. This is demonstrated in a sub-sample of metal-rich RV standards,
which appear to have low surface gravity as measured by the CaH index, yet show
no other evidence of youth. We also use additional youth diagnostics such as
lithium absorption and strong H-alpha emission to set more stringent age
limits. Eleven M dwarfs with no H-alpha emission or absorption are likely old
(>400 Myr) and were caught during an X-ray flare. We estimate that our final
sample of the 144 youngest and nearest low-mass objects in the field is less

three-dimensional orbital solution based on all existing spectroscopic and
astrometric observations including our own yields much improved masses of 2.466

(4920 +/- 70 K and 5680 +/- 70 K), and luminosities (79.5 +/- 4.8 L_Sun and

Capella is unique among evolved stars in that, in addition to all of the above,
the chemical composition is known, including the overall metallicity [m/H], the
carbon isotope ratio 12C/13C for the primary, and the lithium abundance and C/N
ratios for both components. The latter three quantities are sensitive
diagnostics of evolution, and change drastically for giants as a result of the
deepening of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The secondary
is crossing the Hertzprung gap, while the primary is believed to be in the
longer-lived core-helium burning phase. However, we find that current stellar
evolution models are unable to match all of the observations for both
components at the same time, and at a single age, for any evolutionary state of
the primary. Similar problems are found when testing the rotational
synchronization, spin axis alignment, and orbital circularization of the system
against tidal theory. We conclude that our understanding of the advanced stages
of stellar evolution is still very incomplete. [Abridged]

  metal-poor globular cluster NGC6397","  To alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the primordial lithium
abundance in the universe and the abundances observed in Pop II dwarfs and
subgiant stars, it has been suggested that the stars observable today have
undergone photospheric depletion of Li. To constrain the nature of such
depletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars in
the metal-poor globular cluster NGC6397, covering well all evolutionary phases
from below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. Non-LTE
Li abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for a
size-able sub-set of the targets also Na abundances are obtained. The sodium
abundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material from
stars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generation
of more massive stars. The dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form a
thin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by the
lithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. A second steep abundance drop
is seen at the red giant branch bump. The turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,
by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. In
addition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,
which may be a signature of the so-called Li dip in the cluster, commonly seen
among PopI stars. A considerably large spread in Na abundance confirms that
NGC6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limited
number of Na-enhanced and Li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form a
significant anti-correlation between the abundances of Na and Li. The inferred
Li abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure models
including atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.

We identify one narrow nuclear level in B9, E_{5/2^+} \simeq 16.7 MeV that is
not sufficiently studied experimentally, and being just \sim 200 keV above the
Be7+d threshold, may lead to the resonant enhancement of Be7(d,\gamma)B9 and

achieved if the interaction radius for the deterium entrance channel is very

pattern. The approximately equal hierarchies between successive generations,
the sizes of the mixing angles, the heaviness of just the top quark, and the
approximate down-lepton equality can all be accommodated by many flavor models
but can appear ad hoc. We present a simple, predictive mechanism to explain
these patterns. All generations are treated democratically and the flavor
symmetries are broken collectively by only two allowed couplings in
flavor-space, a vector and matrix, with arbitrary O(1) entries. Repeated use of
these flavor symmetry breaking spurions radiatively generates the Yukawa
couplings with a natural hierarchy. We demonstrate this idea with two models in
a split supersymmetric grand unified framework, with minimal additional
particle content at the unification scale. Although flavor is generated at the
GUT scale, there are several potentially testable predictions. In our minimal
model the usual prediction of exact b-tau unification is replaced by the SU(5)
breaking relation m_tau / m_b = 3 / 2, in better agreement with observations.
Other SU(5) breaking effects in the fermion masses can easily arise directly
from the flavor model itself. The symmetry breaking that triggers the
generation of flavor necessarily gives rise to an axion, solving the strong CP
problem. These theories contain long-lived particles whose decays could give
striking signatures at the LHC and may solve the primordial Lithium problems.
These models also give novel proton decay signatures which can be probed by the
next generation of experiments. Measurement of the various proton decay
channels directly probes the flavor symmetry breaking couplings. In this
scenario the Higgs mass is predicted to lie in a range near 150 GeV.

Whilst F- and G-type stars in IC 4665 have depleted little or no lithium, the

the nuclear turn-off, from isochronal matches to low-mass stars or from the
re-appearance of lithium previously found in much lower mass stars (the

perhaps composition or rotation, are very influential in determining the degree
of PMS Li-depletion in stars with M greater than 0.5 Msun. Further work is
required to identify and assess the effects of these additional parameters,

investigation of ultracold quantum gases. Flow equations are derived for a Bose
gas with approximately pointlike interaction, for a Fermi gas with two
(hyperfine) spin components in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover and for a Fermi gas with three
components. The solution of the flow equations determine the properties of
these systems both in the few-body regime and in thermal equilibrium.
  For the Bose gas this covers the quantum phase diagram, the condensate and
superfluid fraction, the critical temperature, the correlation length, the
specific heat or sound propagation. The properties are discussed both for three
and two spatial dimensions. The discussion of the Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC
crossover concentrates on the effect of particle-hole fluctuations but
addresses the complete phase diagram. For the three component fermions, the
flow equations in the few-body regime show a limit-cycle scaling and the Efimov
tower of three-body bound states. Applied to the case of Lithium they explain
recently observed three-body loss features. Extending the calculations by
continuity to nonzero density, it is found that a new trion phase separates a
BCS and a BEC phase for three component fermions close to a common resonance.
  More formal is the derivation of a new exact flow equation for scale
dependent composite operators. This equation allows for example a better
treatment of bound states.

associations have either been newly identified, or had their member list better
defined. These associations, with ages between about 6 Myr and 70 Myr, form an
excellent sample to study the Li depletion in the pre-main sequence (PMS)
evolution. We investigate the use of Li abundances as an independent clock to
constrain the PMS evolution. We have calculated the LTE Li abundances for 376
members of different young associations. In addition we considered the effects
of their projected stellar rotation. We present the Li depletion as function of
age in the first hundred million years for the first time for the most extended
sample of Li abundances in young stellar associations. A clear Li depletion can
be measured in the temperature range from 5000K to 3500K for the age span
covered by these nine associations. The age sequence based on the Li-clock
agrees well with the isochronal ages, $\epsilon$Cha association being the only
possible exception. The lithium depletion patterns for those associations
resemble those of the young open clusters, strengthening the notion that the
members proposed for these loose young associations have indeed a common
physical origin. The observed scatter in the Li abundances hampers the use of
Li to determine reliable ages for individual stars. Rotation velocities above
20 km s$^{-1}$ seem to inhibit the Li depletion.

They can thus be considered a good place to study the Spite plateau and probe
for possible evolutionary modifications of the Li content. We want to determine
the Li content of subgiant (SG) and Main Sequence (MS) stars of the old,
metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397. This work was aimed not only at studying
possible Li abundance variations but to investigate the cosmological Li
discrepancy. Here, we present FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations of a sample of 84 SG
and 79 MS stars in NGC 6397 selected in a narrow range of B-V colour and,
therefore, effective temperatures. We determine both Teff and A(Li) using 3D
hydrodynamical model atmospheres for all the MS and SG stars of the sample. We
find a significant difference in the Li abundance between SG stars and MS
stars, the SG stars having an A(Li) higher by almost 0.1 dex on average. We
also find a decrease in the A(Li) with decreasing Teff, both in MS and SG
stars, albeit with a significantly different slope for the two classes of
stars. This suggests that the lithium abundance in these stars is, indeed,
altered by some process, which is Teff-dependent. The Li abundance pattern
observed in NGC 6397 is different from what is found among field stars, casting
some doubt on the use of Globular Cluster stars as representative of Population
II with respect to the Li abundance. None of the available theories of Li
depletion appears to satisfactorily describe our observations.

produced by scattering processes in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere
showed that the Q/I profile of the lithium doublet at 6708 A has an amplitude
~10^{-4} and a curious three-peak structure, qualitatively similar to that
found and confirmed by many observers in the Na I D_2 line. Given that a
precise measurement of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium
doublet lies at the limit of the present observational possibilities, it is
worthwhile to clarify the physical origin of the observed polarization, its
diagnostic potential and what kind of Q/I shapes can be expected from theory.
To this end, we have applied the quantum theory of atomic level polarization
taking into account the hyperfine structure of the two stable isotopes of
lithium, as well as the Hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field of
arbitrary strength. We find that quantum interferences between the sublevels
pertaining to the upper levels of the D_2 and D_1 line transitions of lithium
do not cause any observable effect on the emergent Q/I profile. Our theoretical
calculations show that only two Q/I peaks can be expected, with the strongest
one caused by the D_2 line of ^7Li I and the weakest one due to the D_2 line of
^6Li I. Interestingly, we find that these two peaks in the theoretical Q/I
profile stand out clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin
atmospheric region that produces the emergent spectral line radiation is lower
than 4000 K. The fact that such region is located around a height of 200 km in
standard semi-empirical models, where the kinetic temperature is about 5000 K,
leads us to suggest that the most likely Q/I profile produced by the sun in the
lithium doublet should be slightly asymmetric and dominated by the ^7Li I peak.

average metallicity, lithium, and light (Sr, Y, Zr) and heavy (Ba, La, Nd, Sm)
s-element abundances. The observed properties of the stars (galactic
distribution, kinematics, binarity, photometry and luminosity) are also
discussed. Our analysis shows that late-R stars are carbon stars with identical
chemical and observational characteristics than the normal (N-type) AGB carbon
stars. We confirm the results of the sole previous abundance analysis of
early-R stars by Dominy (1984, ApJS, 55, 27), namely: they are carbon stars
with near solar metallicity showing enhanced nitrogen, low carbon isotopic
ratios and no s-element enhancements. In addition, we have found that early-R
stars have Li abundances larger than expected for post RGB tip giants. We also
find that a significant number (aprox. 40 %) of the early-R stars in our sample
are wrongly classified, being probably classical CH stars and normal K giants.
In consequence, we suggest that the number of true R stars is considerably
lower than previously believed. We briefly discuss the different scenarios
proposed for the formation of early-R stars. The mixing of carbon during an
anomalous He-flash is favoured, although no physical mechanism able to trigger
that mixing has been found yet. The origin of these stars still remains a
mystery.

surprise because of the high values observed. Non-standard models of Big Bang
nucleosynthesis and pre-Galactic cosmic ray fusion and spallation have been
proposed to explain these values. However, the observations of this light
isotope are challenging which may make some detections disputable. The goal was
to determine 6Li/7Li for a sample of metal-poor stars; three of them have been
previously studied and the remaining two are new for this type of study. The
purpose was to increase, if possible, the number of lithium-6 detections and to
confirm previously published results. Spectra of the resonance doublet line of
neutral lithium Li I 670.78nm were taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph
at the Subaru 8.2m-telescope for a sample of five metal-poor stars (-3.12 <
[Fe/H] < -2.19). The contribution of lithium-6 to the total observed line
profile was estimated from the 1D-LTE analysis of the line asymmetry. Observed
asymmetries could be reproduced assuming isotopic abundance ratios 6Li/7Li of
the order of: 0.004 for BD+26 3578, ~ 0.010 for BD+02 3375 and G 64-37, 0.025
for BD+20 3603 and 0.047 for BD-04 3208. We found that these results were very
sensitive to several of the assumptions made in the analysis, in particular,
the treatment of the residual structure in the analysed spectra. Our final
estimates for the errors are respectively delta_6Li/7Li=+- 0.028, 0.029, 0.039,
0.025 and 0.039. The 6Li/7Li ratios for the sample are comparable to or even
lower than these error values, so that detections of lithium-6 can not safely
be claimed despite of the high resolving power (R ~ 95 000) and S/N (400-600).

stars. We also detect a positive slope of Li abundance with effective
temperature, the higher the temperature the higher the Li abundance, both for
SG and MS stars, although the slope is slightly steeper for MS stars. These

  IC 4651 - New test for hydrodynamical stellar models","  [abridged] Previous analyses of lithium abundances in main sequence and red
giant stars have revealed the action of mixing mechanisms other than convection
in stellar interiors. Beryllium abundances in stars with lithium abundance
determinations can offer valuable complementary information on the nature of
these mechanisms. Our aim is to derive beryllium abundances along the whole
evolutionary sequence of an open cluster, IC 4651. These Be abundances are used
together with previously determined Li abundances, in the same sample stars, to
investigate the mixing mechanisms in a range of stellar masses and evolutionary
stages. New beryllium abundances are determined from high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise UVES spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres.
The careful synthetic modelling of the Be lines region is used to calculate
reliable abundances in rapidly rotating stars. The observed behavior of Be and
Li is compared to theoretical predictions from stellar models including
rotation-induced mixing, internal gravity waves, atomic diffusion, and
thermohaline mixing. Beryllium is detected in all the main sequence and
turn-off sample stars, both slow- and fast-rotating stars, including the Li-dip
stars, but was not detected in the red giants. Confirming previous results, we
find that the Li dip is also a Be dip, although the depletion of Be is more
modest than that of Li in the corresponding effective temperature range. For
post-main-sequence stars, the Be dilution starts earlier within the Hertzsprung
gap than expected from classical predictions as does the Li dilution. A clear
dispersion in the Be abundances is also observed. Theoretical stellar models
including the hydrodynamical transport processes mentioned above are able to
reproduce well all the observed features.

stars leads to systematic asymmetries of the emergent spectral line profiles.
Since such line asymmetries are very small, they can be safely ignored for
standard spectroscopic abundance analysis. However, when it comes to the
determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio, q(Li)=n(6Li)/n(7Li), the intrinsic
asymmetry of the 7Li line must be taken into account, because its signature is
essentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6Li blend in the red
wing of the 7Li line. In this contribution we quantity the error of the
inferred 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio that arises if the convective line asymmetry is
ignored in the fitting of the lithium blend at 6707 A. Our conclusion is that
6Li/7Li ratios derived by Asplund et al. (2006), using symmetric line profiles,
must be reduced by typically dq(Li) ~ 0.015. This diminishes the number of
certain 6Li detections from 9 to 4 stars or less, casting some doubt on the
existence of a 6Li plateau.

  periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides","  In this paper, we address the issue of the generation of non-degenerate
cross-polarization-entangled photon pairs using type-II periodically poled
lithium niobate. We show that, by an appropriate engineering of the
quasi-phase-matching grating, it is possible to simultaneously satisfy the
conditions for two spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes, namely
ordinary pump photon down-conversion to either extraordinary signal and
ordinary idler paired photons, or to ordinary signal and extraordinary idler
paired photons. In contrast to single type-II phase-matching, these two
processes, when enabled together, can lead to the direct production of
cross-polarization-entangled state for non degenerate signal and idler
wavelengths. Such a scheme should be of great interest in applications
requiring polarization-entangled non degenerate paired photons with, for
instance, one of the entangled photons at an appropriate wavelength being used
for local operation or for quantum storage in an atomic ensemble, and the other
one at the typical wavelength of 1550 nm for propagation through an optical
fiber.

extended systems. Whereas much is known about how to define and calculate
charge gaps in density-functional theory (DFT), and about the relation between
these gaps and derivative discontinuities of the exchange-correlation
functional, much less is know about spin gaps. In this paper we give
density-functional definitions of spin-conserving gaps, spin-flip gaps and the
spin stiffness in terms of many-body energies and in terms of single-particle
(Kohn-Sham) energies. Our definitions are as analogous as possible to those
commonly made in the charge case, but important differences between spin and
charge gaps emerge already on the single-particle level because unlike the
fundamental charge gap spin gaps involve excited-state energies. Kohn-Sham and
many-body spin gaps are predicted to differ, and the difference is related to
derivative discontinuities that are similar to, but distinct from, those
usually considered in the case of charge gaps. Both ensemble DFT and
time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) can be used to calculate these spin discontinuities
from a suitable functional. We illustrate our findings by evaluating our
definitions for the Lithium atom, for which we calculate spin gaps and spin
discontinuities by making use of near-exact Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and,
independently, from the single-pole approximation to TDDFT. The many-body
corrections to the Kohn-Sham spin gaps are found to be negative, i.e., single
particle calculations tend to overestimate spin gaps while they underestimate
charge gaps.

Intuitively, this response is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the
widths of the valence and conduction bands and hence a more pronounced
free-electron-like behaviour. But at the densities that can now be achieved
experimentally, compression can be so substantial that core electrons overlap.
This effect dramatically alters electronic properties from those typically
associated with simple free-electron metals such as lithium and sodium, leading
in turn to structurally complex phases and superconductivity with a high
critical temperature. But the most intriguing prediction - that the seemingly
simple metals Li and Na will transform under pressure into insulating states,
owing to pairing of alkali atoms - has yet to be experimentally confirmed. Here
we report experimental observations of a pressure-induced transformation of Na
into an optically transparent phase at 200 GPa (corresponding to 5.0-fold
compression). Experimental and computational data identify the new phase as a
wide bandgap dielectric with a six-coordinated, highly distorted
double-hexagonal close-packed structure. We attribute the emergence of this
dense insulating state not to atom pairing, but to p-d hybridizations of
valence electrons and their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice
interstices. We expect that such insulating states may also form in other
elements and compounds when compression is sufficiently strong that atomic
cores start to overlap strongly.

protosolar, yet the temperature at the base of the surface convective zone is
not hot enough to burn Li. A large range of Li abundances in solar type stars
of the same age, mass and metallicity is observed, but theoretically difficult
to understand. An earlier suggestion that Li is more depleted in stars with
planets was weakened by the lack of a proper comparison sample of stars without
detected planets. Here we report Li abundances for an unbiased sample of
solar-analogue stars with and without detected planets. We find that the
planet-bearing stars have less than 1 per cent of the primordial Li abundance,
while about 50 per cent of the solar analogues without detected planets have on
average 10 times more Li. The presence of planets may increase the amount of
mixing and deepen the convective zone to such an extent that the Li can be
burned.

We find that model color-magnitude diagrams cannot be reliably used to infer

known mass. (2) Effective temperatures inferred from evolutionary model radii
are typically inconsistent with temperatures derived from fitting atmospheric

envelopes of low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We have
evolved models of 1, 1.5 and 2 solar masses from the pre-main sequence to the
end of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch with thermohaline mixing
applied throughout the simulations. In agreement with other authors, we find
that thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the
upper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small
amount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the
AGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal
pulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not
substantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in
carbon-13. The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the
early thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish
rapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the carbon-12 to carbon-13
ratio is still able to reach values of 10^3-10^4, which is inconsistent with
the values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. We also note a
surprising increase in the lithium-7 abundance, with log epsilon(Li-7) reaching
values of over 2.5 in the 1.5 solar mass model. It is thus possible to get
stars which are both C- and Li-rich at the same time. We compare our models to
measurements of carbon and lithium in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars which
have not yet reached the giant branch. These models can simultaneously
reproduced the observed C and Li abundances of carbon-enhanced metal-poor
turn-off stars that are Li-rich, but the observed nitrogen abundances still
cannot be matched.

of Sub-Giant (SG) stars of the same B-V colour. Our final sample is composed of
84 SG stars and 79 MS stars. In spite of the fact that SG and MS span the same
temperature range we find that the equivalent widths of the Li I doublet in SG
stars are systematically larger than those in MS stars, suggesting a higher Li
content among SG stars. This is confirmed by our quantitative analysis. We
derived the effective temperatures, from H$\alpha$ fitting, and NLTE Li
abundances of the stars in our the sample, using 3D and 1D models. We find that
SG stars have a mean Li abundance higher by 0.1dex than MS stars, using both 1D

temperature. These results provide an unambiguous evidence that the Li
abundance changes with evolutionary status. The physical mechanisms responsible
for this behaviour are not yet clear, and none of the existing models seems to
describe accurately these observations. Based on these conclusions, we believe
that the cosmological lithium problem still remains an open question.

the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of
the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a
combination of Resonant Valence Bond (RVB) and Excitonic Insulator physics, and
incorporating Boson-Fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different
fashion the latter leads to some similarites with the high temperature

made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural
form which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable

stars through the process of Hot Bottom Burning. In Globular Clusters, this
processing is one possible source of the hot-CNO burning whose nuclear products
are then ejected into the intracluster medium and take part in the formation of
a second stellar generation, explaining the peculiar distribution of chemical
elements among the cluster stars. We discuss the lithium yields from AGB stars
in the mass range 3-6.3 Msun, and from super-AGB stars of masses in the range
6.5-9 Msun for metallicity Z=0.001. The qualitative behaviour of these yields
is discussed in terms of the physical structure of the different masses.
Although many uncertainties affect the other yields of these stars (e.g. O, Na
and Mg), even larger uncertainties affect the lithium yield, as it depends
dramatically on the adopted description of mass loss. When we adopt our
standard mass loss formulation, very large yields are obtained especially for
the super-AGB stars, and we discuss their possible role on the lithium
abundance of second generation stars in globular clusters.

Caffau et al. (2008, 2009) do not agree as well with helioseismic inferences as
models that use the higher Grevesse & Noels (1993) or Grevesse & Sauval (1998)
abundances. Adopting the new abundances leads to models with sound speed
discrepancies of up to 1.4$%$ below the base of the convection zone (compared
to discrepancies of less than 0.4$%$ with the old abundances), a convection
zone that is too shallow, and a convection zone helium abundance that is too
low. Here we review briefly recent attempts to restore agreement, and we
evaluate three changes to the models: early mass loss, accretion of low-Z
material, and convective overshoot. One goal of these attempts is to explore
models that could preserve the structure in the interior obtained with the old
abundances while accommodating the new abundances at the surface. Although the
mass-losing and accretion models show some improvement in agreement with
seismic constraints, a satisfactory resolution to the solar abundance problem
remains to be found. In addition, we perform a preliminary analysis of models
with the Caffau et al. (2008, 2009) abundances that shows that the sound speed
discrepancy is reduced to only about 0.6$%$ at the convection zone base,
compared to 1.4$%$ for the Asplund et al. (2005) abundances and 0.4$%$ for the
Grevesse & Noels (1993) abundances. Furthermore, including mass loss in models
with the Caffau et al. (2008, 2009) abundances may improve sound speed
agreement and help resolve the solar lithium problem.

great potential for basic science, medicine, energy, and defense. We consider
here a new and general approach to isotope separation. The method is based on
an irreversible change of the mass-to-magnetic moment ratio of a particular
isotope in an atomic beam, followed by a magnetic multipole whose gradients
deflect and guide the atoms. The underlying mechanism is a reduction of the
entropy of the beam by the information of a single-scattered photon for each
atom that is separated. We numerically simulate isotope separation for a range
of examples, including lithium, for which we describe the experimental setup we
are currently constructing. Simulations of other examples demonstrate this
technique's general applicability to almost the entire periodic table. We show
that the efficiency of the process is only limited by the available laser
power, since one photon on average enables the separation of one atom. The
practical importance of the proposed method is that large-scale isotope
separation should be possible, using ordinary inexpensive magnets and the
existing technologies of supersonic beams and lasers.

young sigma Orionis open cluster, which is a benchmark for star-forming
studies. Because of the very low proper motion of the cluster, late-type dwarfs
with appreciable proper motion in the foreground of sigma Orionis can be easily
discarded for expensive spectroscopic follow-up. Methods: I use the Aladin sky
atlas, USNO-B1, public astrometric catalogues, and photographic plate
digitisations to identify stars with proper motions inconsistent with cluster
membership in a circular area of radius 30 arcmin centred on the early-type
multiple system sigma Ori. Mostly due to the long time baseline, of more than
half a century, the errors in the measured proper motions are lower than 2
mas/a. Results: Of the 42 stars selected for astrometric follow-up, 37 of them
are proper-motion cluster interlopers. Some USNO-B1 measurements were affected
by partially resolved (visual) multiplicity and target faintness. Because of
their late spectral types and, hence, red colours, 24 contaminants had been
considered as sigma Orionis members at some moment. I discuss how contamination
may have affected previous works (especially related to disc frequencies) and
the curious presence of lithium absorption in three M-dwarf proper-motion
contaminants. Finally, I classify the bright star HD 294297 as a late-F field
dwarf unrelated to the cluster based on a new proper motion measurement.
Conclusions: Although proper motions cannot be used to confirm membership in
sigma Orionis, they can be used instead to discard a number of cluster member
candidates without spectroscopy.

high resolution spectra for members of the Beta Pictoris Moving Group (BPMG),

combine the lithium abundance with the predictions of pre-main-sequence
evolutionary models in order to calculate a lithium depletion age for each

model. We find that the evolutionary models under-predict the amount of lithium
depletion for the BPMG given its nominal HR diagram age of ~12 Myr (Zuckerman
et al. 2001), particularly for the mid-M stars, which have no observable Li I
line. This results in systematically older ages calculated from lithium
depletion isochrones than from the HR diagram. We suggest that this discrepancy
may be related to the discrepancy between measured M-dwarf radii and the
smaller radii predicted by evolutionary models.

from pristine boron abundances in cool stars as well as early-type stars in the
Galactic disk. The trend of B with Fe obtained from cool F-G dwarfs in the disk

similar to the slope of B with Fe found for the metal poor halo stars and there
seems to be a smooth connection between the halo and disk in the chemical
evolution of boron. The disk trend of boron with oxygen has a steeper slope of
~1.5. This slope suggests an intermediate behavior between primary and
secondary production of boron with respect to oxygen. The slope derived for
oxygen is consistent with the slope obtained for Fe provided that [O/Fe]

variance with most of the other elements, they cannot be formed in stars
through steady hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. The 7Li isotope is synthesized
during primordial nucleosynthesis in the first minutes after the Big Bang and
later by cosmic rays, by novae and in pulsations of AGB stars (possibly also by
the ""nu"" process). 6Li is mainly formed by cosmic rays. The oldest (most
metal-deficient) warm galactic stars should retain the signature of these
processes if, (as it had been often expected) lithium is not depleted in these
stars. The existence of a ""plateau"" of the abundance of 7Li (and of its slope)
in the warm metal-poor stars is discussed. At very low metallicity ([Fe/H]<-2.7
dex the star to star scatter increases significantly towards low Li abundances.
The highest value of the lithium abundance in the early stellar matter of the
Galaxy (A(7Li) = 2.2 dex) is much lower than the the value A(7Li) = 2.72
predicted by the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis, according to the
specifications found by the satellite WMAP. After gathering a homogeneous
stellar sample, and analysing its behaviour, possible explanations of the
disagreement between Big Bang and stellar abundances are discussed (including
early astration and diffusion). On the other hand, possibilities of lower
productions of 7Li in the standard and/or non-standard Big Bang nucleosyntheses
are briefly evoked. A surprisingly high value (A(6Li)=0.8 dex) of the abundance
of the 6Li isotope has been found in a few warm metal-poor stars. Such a high
abundance of 6Li independent of the mean metallicity in the early Galaxy cannot
be easily explained. But are we really observing 6Li ?

LTE abundance analyses of late-type stars for the light elements (here: H, He,
Li, Be and B). The advent of realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and
the availability of non-LTE line formation codes place the stellar analyses on
a much firmer footing and indeed drastically modify the astrophysical
interpretations in many cases, especially at low metallicities. For the
Teff-sensitive hydrogen lines both stellar granulation and non-LTE are likely
important but the combination of the two has not yet been fully explored. A
fortuitous near-cancellation of significant but opposite 3D and non-LTE effects
leaves the derived 7Li abundances largely unaffected but new atomic collisional
data should be taken into account. We also discuss the impact on 3D non-LTE
line formation on the estimated lithium isotopic abundances in halo stars in

  5822 and IC 4756","  Classical chemical analyses may be affected by systematic errors that would
cause observed abundance differences between dwarfs and giants. For some
elements, however, the abundance difference could be real. We address the issue
by observing 2 solar--type dwarfs in NGC 5822 and 3 in IC 4756, and comparing
their composition with that of 3 giants in either of the aforementioned
clusters. We determine iron abundance and stellar parameters of the dwarf
stars, and the abundances of calcium, sodium, nickel, titanium, aluminium,
chromium, silicon and oxygen for both the giants and dwarfs. We acquired UVES
high-resolution, of high signal--to--noise ratio (S/N) spectra. The width of
the cross correlation profiles was used to measure rotation velocities. For
abundance determinations, the standard equivalent width analysis was performed
differentially with respect to the Sun. For lithium and oxygen, we derived
abundances by comparing synthetic spectra with observed line features. We find
an iron abundance for dwarf stars equal to solar to within the margins of error
for IC 4756, and slightly above for NGC 5822 ([Fe/H]= 0.01 and 0.05 dex
respectively). The 3 stars in NG 4756 have lithium abundances between Log N(Li)
2.6 and 2.8 dex, the two stars in NGC 5822 have Log N(Li) ~ 2.8 and 2.5,
respectively. For sodium, silicon, and titanium, we show that abundances of
giants are significantly higher than those of the dwarfs of the same cluster
(about 0.15, 0.15, and 0.35 dex).

Lithium problem, which is the substantial mismatch between the theoretical
prediction for 7-Li from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value that we observe
today. This observation is one of the very few we have from along our past

  NLTE","  One of the most important factors in determining the stellar lithium
abundance is the effective temperature. In a previous study by the authors, new
effective temperatures Teff for sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs were derived
using a local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) description of the formation of
Fe lines. This new Teff scale reinforced the discrepancy. For six of the stars
from our previous study we calculate revised temperatures using a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) approach. These are then used to derive a new
mean primordial lithium abundance in an attempt to solve the lithium
discrepancy. Using the code MULTI we calculate NLTE corrections to the LTE
abundances for the Fe I lines measured in the six stars, and determine new
Teff's. We keep other physical parameters, i.e. log g, [Fe/H] and xi, constant
at the values calculated in Paper I. With the revised Teff scale we derive new
Li abundances. We compare the NLTE values of Teff with the photometric
temperatures of Ryan et al. (1999, ApJ, 523, 654), the infrared flux method
(IRFM) temperatures of Melendez & Ramirez (2004, ApJ, 615, 33), and the Balmer
line wing temperatures of Asplund et al. (2006, ApJ, 644, 229). We find that
our temperatures are hotter than both the Ryan et al. and Asplund et al.
temperatures by typically ~ 110 K - 160 K, but are still cooler than the
temperatures of Melendez & Ramirez by typically ~ 190 K. The temperatures imply
a primordial Li abundance of 2.19 dex or 2.21 dex, depending on the magnitude
of collisions with hydrogen in the calculations, still well below the value of
2.72 dex inferred from WMAP + BBN. We discuss the effects of collisions on
trends of 7Li abundances with [Fe/H] and Teff, as well as the NLTE effects on
the determination of log g through ionization equilibrium, which imply a
collisional scaling factor SH > 1 for collisions between Fe and H atoms.

  stars","  The relative distribution of abundances of refractory, intermediate, and
volatile elements in stars with planets can be an important tool for
investigating the internal migration of a giant planet. This migration can lead
to the accretion of planetesimals and the selective enrichment of the star with
these elements. We report on a spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances of the parent stars in transiting planets
CoRoT-2b and CoRoT-4b. Adding data for CoRoT-3 and CoRoT-5 from the literature,
we find a flat distribution of the relative abundances as a function of their
condensation temperatures. For CoRoT-2, the relatively high lithium abundance
and intensity of its Li I resonance line permit us to propose an age of 120
Myr, making this stars one of the youngest stars with planets to date. We
introduce a new methodology to investigate a relation between the abundances of
these stars and the internal migration of their planets. By simulating the
internal migration of a planet in a disk formed only by planetesimals, we are
able to separate the stellar fractions of refractory (R), intermediate (I), and
volatile (V) rich planetesimals accreting onto the central star. Intermediate
and volatile element fractions enriching the star are similar and much larger
than those of pure refractory ones. We also show that these results are highly
dependent on the model adopted for the disk distribution regions in terms of R,
I, and V elements and other parameters considered. We note however, that this
self-enrichment mechanism is only efficient during the first 20-30 Myr or later
in the lifetime of the disk when the surface convection layers of the central
star for the first time attain its minimum size configuration.

which improves on previous studies of this young cluster by incorporating a
rigorous standardization procedure, thus providing high-fidelity colors and
magnitudes for cluster members. We use this new photometric dataset to
reevaluate the properties (age and distance) of IC4665. Namely, using a
statistical approach incorporating Tau^2 CMD modeling, we measure a
pre-main-sequence isochrone age and distance of 36+-9 Myr and 360+-12 pc, as
well as a upper-main-sequence turn-off age and distance of 42+-12 Myr and
357+-12 pc. These ages and distances are highly dependent on the isochrone
model and color used for the fitting procedure, with a possible range of ~10-20
Myr in age and ~20 pc in distance. This spread in calculated ages and distances
seen between colors and models is likely due to limitations in the individual
membership catalogs and/or systematic differences in the predicted stellar
parameters from the different sets of models. Interestingly, when we compare
the isochrone ages for IC4665 to the published lithium depletion boundary age,
28+-5 Myr, we observe that this cluster does not appear to follow the trend of
isochrone ages being 1.5 times smaller than lithium depletion boundary ages. In
addition, comparing the overall magnetic activity (X-ray and H-alpha emission)
in IC4665 with other well studied open clusters, we find the observed activity
distributions for this young cluster are best characterized by assuming an age
of 30-40 Myr, thus in agreement with our pre-main-sequence and turn-off
isochrone ages for IC4665. Overall, although some age discrepancies do exist,
particularly in the ages measured from pre-main-sequence isochrones, the range
of possible IC4665 ages derived from the various dating techniques employed
here is relatively small compared to that found for other well studied open
clusters.

  lithium burning","  The simplest interior magnetic field B_i that can explain the observed
uniform rotation of the Sun's radiative envelope is an axial dipole stabilized
by a deep toroidal field. It can explain the uniform rotation only if confined
in the polar caps. The field must be prevented from diffusing up into the
high-latitude convection zone, whose slower rotation must remain decoupled from
the radiative interior. This paper describes new analytical and numerical
solutions of the relevant magnetohydrodynamic equations showing that such
confinement and decoupling is dynamically possible by means of a laminar
""magnetic confinement layer"" at the bottom of the tachocline. With realistic
values of the microscopic diffusivities, a weak laminar downwelling flow
U~10^{-5}cm/s over the poles is enough to enforce exponential decay of B_i with
altitude, in a confinement layer only a fraction of a megameter thick.
Downwelling in the polar tachocline is implied both by helioseismic
observations, combined with elementary dynamics, and by theoretical arguments
about the ""gyroscopic pumping"" that would spread differential rotation downward
in the absence of B_i. Our confinement-layer solutions are the first to take
account of all the relevant physical effects in a self-consistent mathematical
model. The effects include magnetic diffusion, baroclinicity and stable
stratification (thermal and compositional), Coriolis effects, and thermal
relaxation. We discuss how the confinement layers at each pole might fit into a
global dynamical picture of the solar tachocline. That picture, in turn,
suggests a new insight into the early Sun and solar lithium depletion.

  magnetostrophic flow","  The global-scale interior magnetic field needed to account for the Sun's
observed differential rotation can be effective only if confined below the
convection zone in all latitudes, including the polar caps. Axisymmetric
nonlinear MHD solutions are obtained showing that such confinement can be
brought about by a very weak downwelling flow U~10^{-5}cm/s over each pole.
Such downwelling is consistent with the helioseismic evidence. All three
components of the magnetic field decay exponentially with altitude across a
thin ""magnetic confinement layer"" located at the bottom of the tachocline. With
realistic parameter values, the thickness of the confinement layer ~10^{-3} of
the Sun's radius. Alongside baroclinic effects and stable thermal
stratification, the solutions take into account the stable compositional
stratification of the helium settling layer, if present as in today's Sun, and
the small diffusivity of helium through hydrogen, chi. The small value of chi
relative to magnetic diffusivity produces a double boundary-layer structure in
which a ""helium sublayer"" of smaller vertical scale is sandwiched between the
top of the helium settling layer and the rest of the confinement layer.
Solutions are obtained using both semi-analytical and purely numerical,
finite-difference techniques. The confinement-layer flows are magnetostrophic
to excellent approximation. More precisely, the principal force balances are
between Lorentz, Coriolis, pressure-gradient and buoyancy forces, with relative
accelerations and viscous forces negligible. This is despite the kinematic
viscosity being somewhat greater than chi. We discuss how the confinement
layers at each pole might fit into a global dynamical picture of the solar
tachocline. That picture, in turn, suggests a new insight into the early Sun
and into the longstanding enigma of solar lithium depletion.

stellar interior, in particular when examining the poorly understood processes
operating in the interior of solar-analog stars. We investigate whether the
large dispersion in the observed lithium abundances of solar-analog stars can
be explained by the depth behavior of the outer convective zone masses, within
the framework of the standard convection model based on the local mixing-length
theory. We also aims to analyze the link between rotation and lithium abundance
in solar-analog stars. We computed a new extensive grid of stellar evolutionary
models, applicable to solar-analog stars, for a finely discretized set of mass
and metallicity. From these models, the stellar mass, age, and mass depth of
the outer convective zone were estimated for 117 solar-analog stars, using Teff
and [Fe/H] available in the literature, and the new HIPPARCOS trigonometric
parallax measurements. We determine the age and mass of the outer convective
zone for a bona fide sample of 117 solar-analog stars. No significant on-to-one
correlation is found between the computed convection zone mass and published
lithium abundance, indicating that the large A(Li) dispersion in solar analogs
cannot be explained by the classical framework of envelope convective mixing
coupled with lithium depletion at the bottom of the convection zone. These
results illustrate the need for an extra-mixing process to explain lithium
behavior in solar-analog stars, such as, shear mixing caused by differential
rotation. To derive a more realistic definition of solar-analog stars, as well
as solar-twin, it seems important to consider the inner physical properties of

  intermediate-mass solar metallicity stars up to the end of the AGB","  (abridged) Numerous spectroscopic observations provide compelling evidence
for non-canonical processes that modify the surface abundances of low- and
intermediate-mass stars beyond the predictions of standard stellar theory. We
study the effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing in
the 1-4 Msun range at solar metallicity. We present evolutionary models by
considering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior.
We discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars
from the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the
early-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars.
Model predictions are compared to observational data for
lithium,12C/13C,[N/C],[Na/Fe],16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters
and in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status,as well as in
planetary nebulae. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed
behaviour of 12C/13C,[N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more
luminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing
initial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB,thermohaline mixing leads to lithium
production, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar
yields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity,
low-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to
change the stellar structure so that in the mass range between \sim 1.5 and 2.2
Msun the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than
in non-rotating models. Finally rotation accounts for the observed star-to-star
abundance variations at a given evolutionary status, and is necessary to
explain the features of CN-processed material in intermediate-mass stars.

rates for these stars, as well as further elucidate some of the processes which
compete with atomic diffusion. Self-consistent stellar evolution models of 1.3
to 2.5 M_sun stars including atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for
all species within the OPAL opacity database were computed with mass loss and
compared to observations as well as previous calculations with turbulent
mixing. Models with unseparated mass loss rates between 5 x 10^-14 and 10^-13
M_sun/yr reproduce observations for many cluster AmFm stars as well as Sirius A
and o Leonis. These models also explain cool Fm stars, but not the Hyades
lithium gap. Like turbulent mixing, these mass loss rates reduce surface
abundance anomalies; however, their effects are very different with respect to
internal abundances. For most of the main sequence lifetime of an A or F star,
surface abundances in the presence of such mass loss depend on separation which
takes place between log(Delta M/M_star)= -6 and -5. The current observational
constraints do not allow us to conclude that mass loss is to be preferred over
turbulent mixing (induced by rotation or otherwise) in order to explain the
AmFm phenomenon. Internal concentration variations which could be detectable
through asteroseismic tests should provide further information. If atomic
diffusion coupled with mass loss are to explain the Hyades Li gap, the wind
would need to be separated.

previous lists by old field stars. We attempt to identify unambiguous moving

combined with the precise Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions to compute
galactic-spatial velocity components. Stars are classified as possible members

the effects of dispersion in the CNOT circuit can be mitigated by augmenting it

spectra. We use astrometry from Keck NGS and LGS AO imaging to determine orbits
for late-M binaries. We find that LP 349-25 (M7.5+M8) is a pair of young brown
dwarfs (Mtot = 0.120 Msun) for which Lyon and Tucson evolutionary models
jointly predict an age of 140+/-30 Myr. This is consistent with the age of the
Pleiades, but at least LP 349-25A defies the empirical Pleiades lithium
depletion boundary, implying that the system is in fact older and that
evolutionary models underpredict the component luminosities. We find that LHS
1901AB (M6.5+M6.5) is a pair of very low-mass stars (Mtot = 0.194 Msun) with
model-derived ages consistent with limits from its lack of activity (> 6 Gyr).
Our improved orbit for Gl 569Bab (M8.5+M9) results in a higher mass for this
binary (Mtot = 0.140 Msun) compared to previous work (0.125 Msun). We use these
masses along with our published results for 2MASS J2206-2047AB (M8+M8) to test
four sets of ultracool model atmospheres currently in use. Fitting these models
to our NIR integrated-light spectra provides temperature estimates warmer by
~250 K than those derived independently from Dusty evolutionary models given
the measured masses and luminosities. We propose that model atmospheres are
more likely to be the source of this discrepancy, as it would be difficult to
explain a uniform temperature offset over such a wide range of masses, ages,
and activity levels in the context of evolutionary models. Our results contrast
those of Konopacky et al. as we find an opposite and smaller mass discrepancy
from what they report when we adopt their model-testing approach since our Teff

the WMAP satellite measurement coupled with the prediction of the standard
big-bang nucleosynthesis theory, and the constant Li abundance measured in
metal-poor halo dwarf stars (the so-called Spite plateau). Several models are
being proposed to explain this discrepancy, involving either new physics, in
situ depletion, or the efficient depletion of Li in the pristine Galaxy by a
generation of massive first stars. The realm of possibilities may be narrowed
considerably by observing stellar populations in different galaxies, which have
experienced different evolutionary histories.
  The WCen stellar system is commonly considered as the remnant of a dwarf
galaxy accreted by the Milky Way (MW). We investigate the Li content of a
conspicuous sample of unevolved stars in this object.
  We obtained moderate resolution (R=17000) spectra for 91 main-sequence/early
sub-giant branch (MS/SGB) WCen stars using the FLAMES-GIRAFFE/VLT spectrograph.
Li abundances were derived by matching the equivalent width of the LiI
resonance doublet at 6708A, to the prediction of synthetic spectra computed
with different Li abundances. Synthetic spectra were computed using the SYNTHE
code along with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The stars effective temperatures are
derived by fitting the wings of the Ha line with synthetic profiles.
  We obtain a mean content of A(Li)=2.19+-0.14~dex for WCen MS/SGB stars. This
is comparable to what is observed in Galactic halo field stars of similar
metallicities and temperatures.
  The Spite plateau seems to be an ubiquitous feature of old, warm metal-poor
stars. It exists also in external galaxies, if we accept the current view about
the origin of WCen. This implies that the mechanism(s) that causes the

accretion on the location of young low-mass stars or brown dwarfs in the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram, we perform a detailed analysis devoted to the
effect of burst accretion on the internal structure of low-mass and solar type
stars. We find that episodic accretion can produce objects with significantly
higher central temperatures than the ones of the non accreting counterparts of
same mass and age. As a consequence, lithium depletion can be severely enhanced
in these objects. This provides a natural explanation for the unexpected level
of lithium depletion observed in young objects for the inferred age of their
parent cluster. These results confirm the limited reliability of lithium
abundance as a criterion for assessing or rejecting cluster membership. They
also show that lithium is not a reliable age indicator, because its fate
strongly depends on the past accretion history of the star. Under the
assumption that giant planets primarily form in massive disks prone to
gravitational instability and thus to accretion burst episodes, the same
analysis also explains the higher Li depletion observed in planet hosting
stars. At last, we show that, depending on the burst rate and intensity,
accretion outbursts can produce solar mass stars with lower convective envelope
masses, at ages less than a few tens of Myr, than predicted by standard (non or
slowly accreting) pre-main sequence models. This result has interesting,
although speculative, implications for the recently discovered depletion of
refractory elements in the Sun.

worldwide over the past years to develop memories suitable for the storage of
quantum states. Of central importance to this task is the preservation of
entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon whose counter intuitive
properties have occupied philosophers, physicists and computer scientists since
the early days of quantum physics. Here we report, for the first time, the
reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a

end, we employ a thulium-doped lithium niobate waveguide in conjunction with a

the current maximum of 100 MHz to 5 GHz. The entanglement-preserving nature of
our storage device is assessed by comparing the amount of entanglement
contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible
transfer, showing, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our

Efimov resonances are identical for both states within the experimental errors

also find that the Efimov features are universally related across Feshbach
resonances. These results crucially depend on careful mapping between the
scattering length and the applied magnetic field which we achieve by
characterization of the two broad Feshbach resonances in the different states

disk stars without detected planets (N=145). The lithium abundances were
derived using a detailed profile fitting of the Li I doublet at lambda 6708 A
in LTE. The planet hosting and comparison stars were chosen to have significant
overlap in their respective physical properties, including effective
temperatures, luminosities, masses, metallicities and ages. The combination of
uniform data and homogeneous analysis with well selected samples, makes this
study well-suited to probe for possible differences in the lithium abundances
found in planet hosting stars. An overall comparison between the two samples
reveals no obvious differences between stars with and without planets. Closer
examination of the behavior of the Li abundances over a narrow range of
effective temperature (5700 K < Teff < 5850 K) indicates subtle differences
between the two stellar samples; this temperature range is particularly
sensitive to various physical processes that can deplete lithium. In this Teff
range planet hosting stars have lower Li abundances (by ~0.26 dex on average)
than the comparison stars, although this segregation may be influenced by
combining stars from a range of ages, metallicities and masses. When stars with
very restricted ranges in metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.00 to +0.20 dex) and mass (M
~ 1.05 - 1.15 Msun are compared, however, both stars with and without planets
exhibit similar behaviors in the lithium abundance with stellar age, suggesting
that there are no differences in the lithium abundances between stars with
planets and stars not known to have planets.

on previous work to investigate these properties. We study whether the
predicted statistical distribution of ion emission line intensities produced by
a specified heating function is affected by the isoelectronic sequence to which
the ion belongs, as well as the characteristic temperature at which it was
formed. Particular emphasis is placed on the strong resonance lines belonging
to the lithium isoelectronic sequence. Predictions for emission lines observed
by existing space-based UV spectrometers are given. The effects on the
statistics of a line when observed with a wide-band imaging instrument rather
than a spectrometer are also investigated. We use a hydrodynamic model to
simulate the UV emission of a loop system heated by nanoflares on small,
spatially unresolved scales. We select lines emitted at similar temperatures
but belonging to different isoelectronic groups: Fe IX and Ne VIII, Fe XII and
Mg X, Fe XVII, Fe XIX and Fe XXIV. Our simulations confirm previous results
that almost all lines have an intensity distribution that follows a power-law,
in a similar way to the heating function. However, only the high temperature
lines best preserve the heating function's power law index (Fe XIX being the
best ion in the case presented here). The Li isoelectronic lines have different
statistical properties with respect to the lines from other sequences, due to
the extended high temperature tail of their contribution functions. However,
this is not the case for Fe XXIV which may be used as a diagnostic of the
coronal heating function. We also show that the power-law index of the heating
function is effectively preserved when a line is observed by a wide-band
imaging instrument rather than a spectromenter.

potential was obtained using a combination of the explicitly correlated
unrestricted coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative
triple excitations [UCCSD(T)-F12] for the core-core and core-valence
correlation and full configuration interaction for the valence-valence
correlation. The potential energy surface has a global minimum 8743 cm^{-1}
deep if the Li-H bond length is held fixed at the monomer equilibrium distance
or 8825 cm^{-1} deep if it is allowed to vary. In order to evaluate the
performance of the conventional CCSD(T) approach, calculations were carried out
using correlation-consistent polarized valence X-tuple-zeta bases, with X
ranging from 2 to 5. The contribution beyond the CCSD(T)-F12 model, obtained
from full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations for the valence-valence

ground-state potential shows an avoided crossing with an ion-pair

between the two potential energy surfaces and its possible impact on the
collisional dynamics. When the LiH bond is allowed to vary, a seam of conical
intersections appears at C_{2v} geometries. At the linear LiH-Li geometry, the
conical intersection is at a Li-H distance which is only slightly larger than
the monomer equilibrium distance, but for nonlinear geometries it quickly
shifts to Li-H distances that are well outside the classical turning points of
the ground-state potential of LiH. Finally, the reaction channels for the
exchange and insertion reactions are also analyzed.

respect to the original ion at the site). We show here that the binding energy

available for diffusion. The concentration of free vacancies initially
increases with dopant concentration, but reaches a maximum at around 1 mol% Li

doping, the corresponding concentration of free vacancies is much higher than
the equilibrium concentrations of charged and neutral vacancies in pure MgH2 at
typical hydrogen storage conditions. We also show that Li-doped MgH2 is
thermodynamically metastable with respect to phase separation into pure

considering the stabilization provided by dopant-vacancy interactions and

  MOA-2010-BLG-285S","  Context: In order to study the evolution of Li in the Galaxy it is necessary
to observe dwarf or subgiant stars. Abridged Although Li has been extensively
studied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain
detection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to
provide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an
analysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.
METHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge
dwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise
spectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was
optically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual
magnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined
through synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at
670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:
MOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected
so far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]
ratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This
star represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf
star in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log
e(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo
dwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results
show that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic
bulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega
Cen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau
is universal.

obtained with the WASP-South and WASP-North instruments shows periodic
transit-like features with a depth of about 1% and a duration of 0.10d every

using z-band photometry obtained with Faulkes Telescope North. High resolution
spectroscopy obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph confirms the presence of a
planetary mass companion. From a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and

estimate that the planet has a mass M_p = 3.60 +- 0.07 M_Jup and a radius R_p =

This red giant (T_eff = 4885 K and log g = 2.65) is a fast rotator with a
projected rotational velocity of 8.4 km/s and an unusually high lithium
abundance of A(Li) = 3.30 dex. Although the lack of a measured parallax
precludes knowing the exact evolutionary phase, an isochrone-derived estimate
of its luminosity places the star on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a
location that is not consistent with either the red bump on the first ascent of
the red giant branch or with the second ascent on the asymptotic giant branch,
the two evolutionary stages where lithium-rich giant stars tend to cluster.
Thus, even among the already unusual group of lithium-rich giant stars,
G0928+73.2600 is peculiar. Using 12C/13C as a tracer for mixing---more mixing
leads to lower 12C/13C---we find 12C/13C = 28, which is near the expected value
for standard first dredge-up mixing. We can therefore conclude that ""extra""
deep mixing has not occurred. Regardless of the ambiguity of the evolutionary
stage, the extremely large lithium abundance and the rotational velocity of
this star are unusual, and we speculate that G0928+73.2600 has been enriched in
both lithium and angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion.

of solar-type stars are studied in order to investigate whether the reported
difference in lithium content of exoplanet-host stars can be related to their
rotational history. Moreover, the asteroseismic properties predicted for stars
with and without exoplanets are compared to determine how such a scenario,
which relates the lithium abundances and the rotational history of the star,
can be further challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations. Methods:
Based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow rotators
on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) are modelled with a comprehensive
treatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast rotators are modelled
including both shellular rotation and magnetic fields. Assuming a possible link
between low rotation rates on the ZAMS and the presence of planets as a result
of a longer disc-locking phase during the pre-main sequence (PMS), we compare
the surface abundances and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotating
models, which correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detected
planets, respectively. Results: We confirm previous suggestions that the
difference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected planets
can be related to their different rotational history. The larger efficiency of
rotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars explains their lithium
depletion and also leads to changes in the structure and chemical composition
of the central stellar layers. Asteroseismic observations can reveal these
changes and can help us distinguish between different possible explanations for
the lower lithium content of exoplanet-host stars.

  Implications for Mixing and Nucleosynthesis in Extremely Metal-Poor Stars and

the Galaxy using the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA)
database (Suda et al. 2008, PASJ, 60, 1159).The analyses of carbon-enhanced
stars in our sample suggest that the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can
contribute to the carbon enrichment in a different way depending on whether the
metallicity is above or below [Fe/H] ~ -2.5, which is consistent with the
current models of stellar evolution at low metallicity. We find the transition
of the initial mass function at [Fe/H] ~ -2 in the viewpoint of the
distribution of carbon abundance and the frequency of carbon-enhanced stars.
For observed EMP stars, we confirmed that some, not all, of observed stars
might have undergone at least two types of extra mixing to change their surface
abundances. One is to deplete the lithium abundance during the early phase of
red giant branch. Another is to decrease the C/N ratio by one order of
magnitude during the red giant branch phase. Observed small scatters of
abundances for alpha-elements and iron-group elements suggest that the chemical
enrichment of our Galaxy takes place in a well-mixed interstellar medium. We
find that the abundance trends of alpha-elements are highly correlated with
each other, while the abundances of iron-group elements are subject to
different slopes relative to the iron abundance. This implies that the
supernova yields of alpha-elements are almost independent of mass and
metallicity, while those of iron-group elements have a metallicity dependence
or mass dependence with the variable initial mass function.The occurrence of
the hot bottom burning in the mass range of 5 <~ M / Msun <~ 6 is consistent
with the initial mass function of the Galaxy peaked at ~ 10 - 12 Msun to be
compatible with the statistics of carbon enhanced stars with and without

polymeric carbon chains can be stabilized in solid Li$_2$C$_2$ under moderate

of twofold zigzag carbon chains embedded in lithium cages, which display a

is 3-4 times greater than the observational values, assuming the

resolved within the standard BBN picture if additional destruction of A=7

of 10C sitting at approximately 15.0 MeV above its ground state with an
effective width of order 10 keV could resolve the 7Li problem; the existence of
this excited state needs experimental verification. Other examples using known
states include 7Be+t \rightarrow 10B(18.80 MeV), and 7Be+d \rightarrow 9B(16.71

give sufficiently large widths. Experimental determination of these reaction
strengths is needed to rule out or confirm these nuclear physics solutions to

  dilution by fingering convection and observational implications","  When a planet falls onto the surface of its host star, the added
high-metallicity material does not remain in the surface layers, as often
assumed, but is diluted into the interior through fingering (thermohaline)
convection. Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens
remained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing
rates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and
semi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain
into the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall
drops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure
of the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from
about 1Gyr for a 1.3M_sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M_sun star). This result
offers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity
and convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars. More crucially, it strongly
suggests that the statistically-higher metallicity of planet-bearing stars must
be of primordial origin. Finally, the fingering region is found to extend
deeply into the star, a result which would provide a simple theoretical
explanation to the measurements of higher lithium depletion rates in
planet-bearing stars.

sufficient since many old stars can share the same spatial motion of those
stars in moving groups. In this contribution we attempt to identify unambiguous
moving groups members, among a sample of nearby-late type stars. High
resolution echelle spectra is used to i) derive accurate radial velocities
which allow us to study the stars' kinematics and make a first selection of
moving groups members; and ii) analyze several age-related properties for young
late-type stars (i.e., lithium LiI 6707.8 Amstrongs, R'HK index). The different
age-estimators are compared and the moving group membership of the
kinematically selected candidates are discussed.

low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Combining the current optical spectroscopy
presented here with near-infrared spectroscopy obtained for the faintest

photometric mass function. The luminosity function drawn from the spectroscopic
sample of 113 USco members peaks at around M6 and is flat at later spectral

a result of the dust properties in substellar atmospheres. The mass function
may peak at 0.2 Msun and is quite flat in the substellar regime. We observe a
possible excess of cool low-mass brown dwarfs compared to IC 348 and the
extrapolation of the field mass functions, supporting the original hypothesis
that Upper Sco may possess an excess of brown dwarfs. This result shows that
the selection of photometric candidates based on five band photometry available

microturbulent and rotational velocities and, Lithium abundances (ALi) for 27
evolved stars of M67 with the spectral synthesis method based on MARCS model
atmospheres. We also computed non-standard stellar evolution models, taking
into account atomic diffusion and rotation-induced transport of angular

Results. The lithium abundances that we derive for the 27 stars in our sample
follow a clear evolutionary pattern ranging from the turn-off to the Red Giant
Branch. Our abundance determination confirms the well known decrease of lithium
content for evolved stars. For the first time, we provide a consistent

angular momentum through rotation-induced mixing in low-mass stars, in
particular for those with initial masses larger than 1.30 M_\odot at solar

lithium and no heavier elements, but some alternatives predict a nonzero
primordial metallicity. Here we explore whether CMB measurements may set useful
constraints to the primordial metallicity and/or whether the standard CMB
calculations are robust, within the tolerance of forthcoming CMB maps, to the
possibility of primordial metals. Metals would affect the recombination history
(and thus CMB power spectra) in three ways: (1) Lyman-alpha photons can be
removed (and recombination thus accelerated) by photoionizing metals. (2) The
Bowen resonance-fluorescence mechanism may degrade Lyman-beta photons and thus
enhance the Lyman-beta escape probability and speed up recombination. (3)
Metals could affect the low-redshift tail of the CMB visibility function by
providing additional free electrons. The last two of these provide the
strongest CMB signal. However, the effects are detectable in the Planck
satellite only if the primordial metal abundance is at least a few hundredths
of solar for (2) and a few tenths of solar for (3). We thus conclude that
Planck will not be able to improve upon current constraints to primordial
metallicity, at the level of a thousandth of solar, from the Lyman-alpha forest
and ultra-metal-poor halo stars, and that the CMB power-spectrum predictions
for Planck suffer no uncertainty arising from the possibility that there may be
primordial metals.

lithiation potentials and capacities in GO can be tuned by controlling the
oxygen coverage, or the degree of reduction. We find a range of coverages where
the lithiation potentials are above the solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
formation threshold, but with capacities comparable to, or larger than
graphite. We observe that in highly oxidized and mildly reduced sheets,
lithiation occurs through the formation of Li-O bonds, whereas at low coverages
that are typical of reduced-GO (rGO) (O:C - 12.5 %), both Li-O bonds and LiC6
configurations are observed. The covalent Li-O bond is much stronger than the
bonds formed in the LiC6 ring and the lithiation potentials for epoxides at
high and medium coverages are generally large (> 1 eV). For these
congifurations, as in the case of Li4Ti5O12 anodes, there will be no formation
of SEI, but with the additional advantage of having higher lithium storage
capacity than Li4Ti5O12. In reduced GO sheets, the presence of residual oxygen
atoms allows for formation of covalent Li-O bonds that lead to storage
capacities and lithiation potentials higher than that of graphite. Finally, our
calculations show high lithiation potentials for the edges of graphene
nanoribbons, which will impede the formation of SEI and hence lead to large
reversible capacity.

giants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. This new
finding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is
the first large survey to include giants well below and above the RGB bump and
clump locations in the HR diagram. Origin of the lithium enrichment may be
plausibly attributed to the conversion of 3He via 7Be to 7Li by the

uncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:
the bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB) and the He-core

serves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in general, a consequence of
a giant swallowing a large planet.

undetected in deep adaptive optics imaging. For a better understanding of the
system we aim to refine the determination of the stellar parameters, with

rotational velocity, chromospheric emission, effective temperature, and
chemical composition. We find no indication of any misalignment between the
star rotation axis and the disk. The standard age calibrations applied to

that the characteristics of HD 61005 are compatible with membership to the
Argus association, once its rather slow rotation is taken into account, because
lithium and other age indicators are somewhat correlated with stellar rotation
at a fixed age. We also identify systematic differences between the field and
cluster population of the Argus association, which are probably selection
effects, so we suggest that additional members with slower rotation and lower
activity level are waiting to be identified.

luminosity spreads necessarily imply large age spreads, by comparing HR diagram
ages with ages from independent clocks such as stellar rotation rate, the
presence of circumstellar material and lithium depletion. I argue that whilst
there probably is a true luminosity dispersion, there is little evidence to

brief periods of rapid accretion during the class I pre main-sequence phase.

stellar interior. The existence of lithium-rich giants still represents a
challenge for stellar evolution models. Aims: We have collected a large
database of high-resolution stellar spectra of 824 candidate thick-disk giants
having 2\,MASS photometry and proper motions measured by the Southern
Proper-Motion Program (SPM). In order to investigate the nature of Li-rich
giants, we searched this database for giants presenting a strong Li\,I
resonance line. Methods: We performed a chemical abundance analysis on the
selected stars with the MOOG code along with proper ATLAS-9 model atmospheres.
The iron content and atmospheric parameters were fixed by using the equivalent
width of a sample of Fe lines. We also derive abundances for C, N, and O and
measure or derive lower limits on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios, which
is a sensible diagnostic of the stars evolutionary status. Results: We detected
five stars with a lithium abundance higher than 1.5, i.e. Li-rich according to
the current definition. One of them (SPM-313132) has A(Li)$>$3.3 and, because
of this, belongs to the group of the rare super Li-rich giants. Its kinematics
makes it a likely thin-disk member and its atmospheric parameters are
compatible with it being a 4\,M$_\odot$ star either on the red giant branch
(RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch. This object is the first super
Li-rich giant detected at this phase. The other four are likely low-mass
thick-disk stars evolved past the RGB luminosity bump, as determined from their
metallicities and atmospheric parameters. The most evolved of them lies close
to the RGB-tip. It has A(Li)$>$2.7 and a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio,
close to the cool bottom processing predictions.

For all the incidence angles considered the proton is scattered away, except in
one interesting case in which one of the Lithium atoms captures it, forming a
LiH molecule. This theoretical formalism proves to be a powerful, effective and
predictive tool for the analysis of non-adiabatic processes at the nanoscale.

giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution. In about one percent of known Miras, the
pulsation period is changing. It has been speculated that this changing period
is the consequence of a recent thermal pulse in these stars. Aims: We aim to
clarify the evolutionary state of these stars, and to determine in particular
whether or not they are in the thermally-pulsing (TP-)AGB phase. Methods: One
important piece of information that has been neglected so far when determining
the evolutionary state is the presence of the radio-active s-process element
technetium (Tc). We obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise-ratio
optical spectra of a dozen prominent Mira variables with changing pulsation
period to search for this indicator of TPs and dredge-up. We also use the
spectra to measure lithium (Li) abundances. Furthermore, we establish the
evolutionary states of our sample stars by means of their present-day periods
and luminosities. Results: Among the twelve sample stars observed in this
programme, five were found to show absorption lines of Tc. BH Cru is found to
be a carbon-star, its period increase in the past decades possibly having
stopped by now. We report a possible switch in the pulsation mode of T UMi from
Mira-like to semi-regular variability in the past two years. R Nor, on the
other hand, is probably a fairly massive AGB star, which could be true for all
meandering Miras. Finally, we assign RU Vul to the metal-poor thick disk with
properties very similar to the short-period, metal-poor Miras. Conclusions: We
conclude that there is no clear correlation between period change class and Tc
presence. The stars that are most likely to have experienced a recent TP are BH
Cru and R Hya, although their rates of period change are quite different.

evolutionary status. This solar-mass red giant (Teff=3460+/-60K and
log(g)=0.6+/-0.2) is characterised by a relatively fast rotation (v
sin(i)~8km/s), slightly subsolar metallicity and a high-lithium abundance,
A(Li)=2.4+/-0.2dex. We discuss IRAS12556-7731 within the context of other known
lithium-rich K-type giants. Because it is close to the tip of the red giant
branch, IRAS12556-7731 is the coolest lithium-rich giant known so far, and it
is among the least massive and most luminous giants where enhancement of
lithium has been detected. Among several possible explanations, we cannot
preclude the possibility that the lithium enhancement and rapid rotation of the
star were triggered by the engulfment of a brown dwarf or a planet.

scintillator doped with enriched Li-6. The lithium was introduced in the form
of an aqueous LiCl micro-emulsion with a di-isopropylnaphthalene-based liquid
scintillator. A Li-6 concentration of 0.15 % by weight was obtained. A 125 mL
glass cell was filled with the scintillator and irradiated with fission-source
neutrons. Fast neutrons may produce recoil protons in the scintillator, and
those neutrons that thermalize within the detector volume can be captured on
the Li-6. The energy of the neutron may be determined by the light output from
recoiling protons, and the capture of the delayed thermal neutron reduces
background events. In this paper, we discuss the development of this 6Li-loaded
liquid scintillator, demonstrate the operation of it in a detector, and compare
its efficiency and capture lifetime with Monte Carlo simulations. Data from a
boron-loaded plastic scintillator were acquired for comparison. We also present

scheme for the generation of nondegenerate, copolarised, modal, and path-
entangled photons using a directional coupler and an asymmetric Y-coupler
geometry in type 0 phase-matched domain engineered lithium niobate(LN)

through numerical simulations, that an almost maximally entangled state is
achievable over a wide range of waveguide parameters. For the degenerate case,
the scheme gives a NOON state for N = 2. The generated entangled photon pairs
should have potential applications in quantum information schemes and also in
quantum metrology. By appropriate domain engineering and component designing,
the idea can be further extended to generate hyperentangled and two-photon
multipath-entangled states, which may have further applications in quantum

fractionation of lithium isotopes between aqueous fluids and various Li bearing

predict the direction of the isotope fractionation as observed in the
experiments. On the quantitative level the computed fractionation factors agree
within 1.0 permil with the experimental values indicating predictive power of
ab initio methods. We show that with ab initio methods we are able to
investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the equilibrium isotope
fractionation process, such as coordination of the fractionating elements,
their bond strengths to the neighboring atoms, compression of fluids and
thermal expansion of solids. This gives valuable insight into the processes

  signature of gas giant planet formation?","  The atmospheric parameters of the components of the 16Cygni binary system, in
which the secondary has a gas giant planet detected, are measured accurately
using high quality observational data. Abundances relative to solar are
obtained for 25 elements with a mean error of 0.023 dex. The fact that 16CygA
has about four times more lithium than 16CygB is normal considering the
slightly different masses of the stars. The abundance patterns of 16CygA and B,
relative to iron, are typical of that observed in most of the so-called solar
twin stars, with the exception of the heavy elements (Z>30), which can,
however, be explained by Galactic chemical evolution. Differential (A-B)
abundances are measured with even higher precision (0.018 dex, on average). We
find that 16CygA is more metal-rich than 16CygB by 0.041+/-0.007 dex. On an
element-to-element basis, no correlation between the A-B abundance differences
and dust condensation temperature (Tc) is detected. Based on these results, we
conclude that if the process of planet formation around 16CygB is responsible
for the observed abundance pattern, the formation of gas giants produces a
constant downwards shift in the photospheric abundance of metals, without a Tc
correlation. The latter would be produced by the formation of terrestrial
planets instead, as suggested by other recent works on precise elemental
abundances. Nevertheless, a scenario consistent with these observations
requires the convective envelopes of 1 Msun stars to reach their present-day
sizes about three times quicker than predicted by standard stellar evolution
models.

Clusters (GCs), and notably the ubiquitous Na-O anti-correlation, are generally
interpreted as evidence that GCs comprise several generations of stars. There
is an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce the
inhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is a
way to shed new light on this problem. Aims. We aim at investigating the Li and
Na content of the GC M 4, that is known to have a well defined Na-O
anti-correlation. Methods. We obtained moderate resolution (R=17 000-18 700)
spectra for 91 main sequence (MS)/sub-giant branch stars of M 4 with the
Giraffe spectrograph at the FLAMES/VLT ESO facility. Using model atmospheres
analysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. Results. We detect a weak
Li-Na anti-correlation among un-evolved MS stars. One star in the sample, #
37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance A(Li)=2.87, compatible with
current estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. Conclusions. The shallow
slope found for the Li-Na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced in
parallel to sodium. This evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,
suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate by
pollution from a previous generations of stars. The recent detection of a
Li-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster NGC 6397 may also
point in this direction. Still, no clear cut evidence is available against a
possible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

binds the electrode together and prevents the electronic isolation of silicon
particles, thereby decreasing capacity loss. Rate capability decreases
significantly at higher copper-coating thicknesses as the silicon

compressive stress is induced in the Si film and it undergoes plastic flow. At
any state-of-charge (SOC), a relatively small delithiation-relithiation
sequence unloads and reloads the film elastically. From the stress and strain
changes during a delithiation-relithiation cycle, the biaxial modulus of the
film is calculated. Stress change is obtained by measuring the change in
substrate curvature using a Multi-beam Optical Sensor; the elastic strain
change is obtained from the change in SOC. By repeating these measurements at
several different values of SOC, the biaxial modulus was seen to decrease from
ca. 70 GPa for Li0.32Si to ca. 35 GPa for Li3.0Si. Such a significant reduction
in elastic modulus has important implications for modeling stress evolution and
mechanical degradation in Si-based anodes.

the negative electrode in lithium-ion cells, mainly due to its high
reversibility and low operating potential. However, carbon anodes exhibit
mediocre charge/discharge rate performance, which contributes to severe
transport-induced surface-structural damage upon prolonged cycling, and limits
the lifetime of the cell. Lithium bulk diffusion in graphitic carbon is not yet
completely understood, partly due to the complexity of measuring bulk transport
properties in finite-sized, non-isotropic particles. To solve this problem for
graphite, we use the Devanathan-Stachurski electrochemical methodology combined
with ab-initio computations to deconvolute, and quantify the mechanism of
lithium-ion diffusion in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The results
reveal inherent high lithium-ion diffusivity in the direction parallel to the
graphene plane (ca. 10^-7 - 10^-6 cm2 s-1), as compared to sluggish lithium-ion
transport along grain boundaries (ca. 10^-11 cm^2 s^-1), indicating the
possibility of rational design of carbonaceous materials and composite
electrodes with very high rate capability.

electrode during electrochemical lithiation and delithiation by using the
Multi-beam Optical Sensor (MOS) technique. Upon lithiation, due to substrate
constraint, the silicon electrode initially undergoes elastic deformation,
resulting in rapid rise of compressive stress. The electrode begins to deform
plastically at a compressive stress of ca. -1.75 GPa; subsequent lithiation
results in continued plastic strain, dissipating mechanical energy. Upon
delithiation, the electrode first undergoes elastic straining in the opposite
direction, leading to a tensile stress of ca. 1 GPa; subsequently, it deforms
plastically during the rest of delithiation. The plastic flow stress evolves
continuously with lithium concentration. Thus, mechanical energy is dissipated
in plastic deformation during both lithiation and delithiation, and it can be
calculated from the stress measurements; we show that it is comparable to the
polarization loss. Upon current interrupt, both the film stress and the
electrode potential relax with similar time-constants, suggesting that stress
contributes significantly to the chemical potential of lithiated-silicon.

that they deplete Li by different degrees during their pre-main sequence phase.
Beryllium abundances are complementary to the lithium ones, and can help
tracing the mixing processes in the stellar interiors. Our aim is to derive
beryllium abundances in a sample of G- and K-type stars of two young pre-main
sequence open clusters, IC 2391 and IC 2602. The Be abundances are used to
investigate the mixing of internal material in these stars. The reliability of
the Be lines as abundance indicators in low-temperatures is also investigated
in detail. We derived Be abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise
UVES/VLT spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres. Atmospheric
parameters and other elemental abundances are adopted from a previous work. The
sample stars have masses in the range between 0.80 < M/Msun < 1.20. They have
been shown to differ in lithium abundance by about 0.60 dex, with lower A(Li)
in cooler and lower mass stars. Here, we find that all the stars have the same
Be abundance within the uncertainties. These observations show that the Be
abundance is not affected by the mixing events in the pre-main sequence, in
this mass range, in agreement with the expectation of evolutionary models. A
comparison with Be abundances in older clusters shows that, contrary to the
models, cool stars deplete Be during their main-sequence lifetime, confirming
what has been previously suggested in the literature.

Raman spectra of graphitic anodes reveal that cycling at potentials that

The extent of surface structural disorder in graphite is significantly reduced

surface of graphite during early stages of intercalation processes, and the
inherent increase of the LixC d-spacing tend to induce local stresses at the
edges of graphene layers, and lead to the breakage of C-C bonds. The exposed
graphite edge sites react with the electrolyte to (re)form the SEI layer, which

period of 147.8919+-0.0003 days and a large eccentricity of e=0.8086+-0.0001.
The rms of the orbital solution is just 47 m/s, making it the most precise
orbit ever obtained for an active binary system. The rotation period is
constrained from long-term photometry to be 58.32+-0.01 days. It shows that HD
123351 is a very asynchronous rotator, rotating five times slower than the
expected pseudo-synchronous value. Two spotted regions persisted throughout the
12 years of our observations. Four years of Halpha, CaII H&K and HeI D3
monitoring identifies the same main periodicity as the photometry but dynamic
spectra also indicate that there is an intermittent dependence on the orbital
period, in particular for Ca ii H&K in 2008. Line-profile inversions of a pair
of Zeeman sensitive/insensitive iron lines yield an average surface
magnetic-flux density of 542+-72 G. The time series for 2008 is modulated by
the stellar rotation as well as the orbital motion, such that the magnetic flux
is generally weaker during times of periastron and that the chromospheric
emissions vary in anti-phase with the magnetic flux. We also identify a broad

faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although hard particles are known to
organize due to entropy alone, and some unusual phases are reported in the
literature, the role of entropic forces in connection with polyhedral shape is
not well understood. Here, we study thermodynamic self-assembly of a family of
truncated tetrahedra and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including
diamond, {\beta}-tin, and high- pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape
varies from tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest

and report a new space filling polyhedron, which has been overlooked in
previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled structures differ from the
densest packings. We show that the self-assembled crystal structures can be
understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment,
which can be generalized as directional entropic forces.

rough estimate for the stellar age, we show that the ""lithium"" age of RZ Psc
lies between the age of stars in the Pleiades (approximately 70 Myr) and the
Orion (approximately 10 Myr) clusters. We also roughly estimated the age of RZ
Psc based on the proper motion of the star using the Tycho-2 catalog. We found
that the star has escaped from its assumed birthplace near to the Galactic
plane about 30-40 Myr ago. We conclude that RZ Psc is a post-UXOr star, and its
sporadic eclipses are caused by material from the debris disk.

being near phase-matching and having ultrafast femtosecond response times. Here
we show that in strongly phase-mismatched nonlinear frequency conversion
crystals the pump pulse can experience a large and extremely broadband
self-defocusing cascaded Kerr-like nonlinearity. The large cascaded
nonlinearity is ensured through interaction with the largest quadratic tensor

experimentally by showing few-cycle soliton compression with noncritical
cascaded second-harmonic generation: Energetic 47 fs infrared pulses are
compressed in a just 1-mm long bulk lithium niobate crystal to 17 fs (under 4

Laser cooling of lithium is usually performed on the $2S_{1/2} \rightarrow

the origin of Lithium problem or not. It can be expected that BBNCRs flux will
be small in order to keep the success of standard BBN (SBBN). With favorable
assumptions on the BBNCR spectrum between 0.09 -- 4 MeV, our numerical

of magnitude, which is still much lower than the observed value. As the
deuteron abundance is very sensitive to the spectrum choice of BBNCRs, the
allowed parameter space for the spectrum is strictly constrained. We should
emphasize that the acceleration mechanism for BBNCRs in the early universe is
still an open question. For example, strong turbulent magnetic field is
probably the solution to the problem. Whether such a mechanism can provide the
required spectrum deserves further studies.

wavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. Imaging has
been obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFPC2, Spitzer/MIPS,
and Herschel/SPIRE. Several of the structures around R CrB are cometary
globules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. The estimated
dust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the R CrB
declines if they form along the line of sight to the star. In addition, there
is a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containing
cool 25 K dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. The SED of R CrB
can be well fit by a 150 AU disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelope
which corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. The total masses of
the disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 M(Sun), respectively, assuming a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger or
a final-helium-shell flash origin for R CrB is contradictory. The shell and the
cometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. Along with the
fact that R CrB shows significant Lithium in its atmosphere, this supports the
final-helium-shell flash. However, the relatively high inferred mass of R CrB
and its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

cannot be definitively determined, the Li-rich phase is likely connected to
extra mixing at the red giant branch bump or early asymptotic giant branch that
triggers cool bottom processing in which the bottom of the outer convective
envelope is connected to the H-burning shell in the star. The surface of a star
becomes Li-enhanced as 7Be (which burns to 7Li) is transported to the stellar
surface via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. We discuss and discriminate among
several models for the extra mixing that can cause Li-production, given the
detailed abundances of the Li-rich giants in our sample.

a low-mass companion to the lithium-depleted, double-line spectroscopic binary
HBC 425 (St 34) obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) and the
Keck II adaptive optics system. Positioned 1.23"" southeast of the primary pair,
the companion, HBC 425C, is ~2.4 magnitudes fainter at 2.2 microns.
Moderate-resolution (R~2500) J- and K-band spectroscopy reveal HBC 425C to have
an M5.5 (+/-0.5) spectral type. Comparisons with pre-main sequence evolutionary
models imply a mass of ~0.09 M(Sun) and ages of 8-10 Myr, assuming the nominal
distance of Taurus-Auriga (~140 pc), or ~25 Myr if placed at ~90 pc. We also
present high dispersion, optical spectra of HBC 425 and HBC 425C obtained using
the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck I. We detect strong Li
I 6708 absorption in the spectrum of HBC 425C. Using curves of growth for the
Li I 6708 doublet, we estimate its abundance level to lie between log N(Li)=1.9

strong Balmer line emission, consistent with accretion. We place more
restrictive upper limits on the surface abundance of lithium and find that HBC
425 retains less than ~0.1% of its primordial abundance. The presence of
lithium in the photosphere of HBC 425C does not resolve the discrepancy between
isochronal and lithium depletion ages for the primary pair. However, if lithium
were depleted relative to interstellar abundance levels, even minimally,
considerable support would be gained for the more advanced age of this
hierarchical triple system.

  sample of low-mass Bulge stars","  Context: A small number of K-type giants on the red giant branch (RGB) is
known to be very rich in lithium (Li). This fact is not accounted for by
standard stellar evolution theory. The exact phase and mechanism of Li
enrichment is still a matter of debate. Aims: Our goal is to probe the
abundance of Li along the RGB, from its base to the tip, to confine Li-rich
phases that are supposed to occur on the RGB. Methods: For this end, we
obtained medium-resolution spectra with the FLAMES spectrograph at the VLT in
GIRAFFE mode for a large sample of 401 low-mass RGB stars located in the
Galactic bulge. The Li abundance was measured in the stars with a detectable Li
670.8 nm line by means of spectral synthesis with COMARCS model atmospheres. A
new 2MASS (J-K) - Teff calibration from COMARCS models is presented in the
Appendix. Results: Thirty-one stars with a detectable Li line were identified,
three of which are Li-rich according to the usual criterion ($\log\epsilon({\rm
Li})>1.5$). The stars are distributed all along the RGB, not concentrated in
any particular phase of the red giant evolution (e.g. the luminosity bump or
the red clump). The three Li-rich stars are clearly brighter than the
luminosity bump and red clump, and do not show any signs of enhanced mass loss.
Conclusions: We conclude that the Li enrichment mechanism cannot be restricted
to a clearly defined phase of the RGB evolution of low-mass stars
($M\sim1M_{\sun}$), contrary to earlier suggestions from disk field stars.

PZ Tel. PZ Tel was recently found to host a young and low-mass companion. Using
FEROS spectra we have measured atomic abundances (e.g. Fe and Li) and
chromospheric activity for PZ Tel and used these to obtain metallicity and age
estimates for the companion. We find PZ Tel to be a rapidly rotating
(vsini=73\pm5km/s), ~solar metallicity star (logN(Fe)=-4.37 dex or [Fe/H]=0.05
dex) with a measured mean logR'HK of -4.12. We measure a NLTE lithium abundance
of logN(Li)=3.1\pm0.1dex, which from depletion models gives rise to an age of
7+4-2 Myrs for the system. The measured chromospheric activity returns an age
of 26\pm2Myrs, as does fitting pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks
(Tau_evol=22\pm3Myrs), both of which are in disagreement with the lithium age.
We speculate on reasons for this difference and introduce new models for
lithium depletion that incorporates both rotation and magnetic field affects.
We also synthesize solar, metal-poor and metal-rich substellar evolutionary
models to better determine the bulk properties of PZ Tel B, showing that PZ Tel
B is probably more massive than previous estimates, meaning the companion is
not a giant exoplanet. We show how PZ Tel B compares to other currently known
age and metallicity benchmark systems and try to empirically test the effects
of dust opacity as a function of metallicity on the near infrared colours of
brown dwarfs. Current models suggest that in the near infrared observations are
more sensitive to low-mass companions orbiting more metal-rich stars. We also
look for trends between infrared photometry and metallicity amongst a growing
population of substellar benchmark objects, and identify the need for more data
in mass-age-metallicity parameter space. [Abridged]

relevant to the interior of giant planets; however, knowledge of these phases

solid hydrogen at pressures up to 5 TPa. An exotic quasi-molecular mC24
structure (space group C2/c, stable at 0.47-0.59 TPa) with two types of
intramolecular bonds was predicted, providing a deeper understanding of
molecular dissociation in solid hydrogen, which has been a mystery for decades.
We further predicted the existence of two atomic phases: (i) the oC12 structure
(space group Cmcm, stable at > 2.1 TPa), consisting of planar H3 clusters, and
(ii) the cI16 structure, previously observed in lithium and sodium, stable
above 3.5 TPa upon consideration of the zero-point energy. This work clearly
revised the known zero-temperature and high-pressure (>0.47 TPa) phase diagram

a strong depletion in carbon, but also lithium abundance anomalies that have
been little explored in the literature since the first discovery of these
peculiar objects in the early 50's. Here we focus on the Li-rich WGB stars and
report on their evolutionary status. We explore different paths to propose a
tentative explanation for the lithium anomaly. Using archive data, we derive
the fundamental parameters of WGB (Teff, log g, log(L/Lsun)) using Hipparcos
parallaxes and recent temperature scales. From the equivalent widths of Li
resonance line at 6707 {\AA}, we uniformly derive the lithium abundances and
apply when possible NLTE corrections following the procedure described by Lind
et al. (2009). We also compute dedicated stellar evolution models in the mass
range 3.0 to 4.5 Msun, exploring the effects of rotation-induced and
thermohaline mixing. These models are used to locate the WGB stars in the H-R
diagram and to explore the origin of the abundance anomalies. The location of
WGB stars in the H-R diagram shows that these are intermediate mass stars of
masses ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 Msun located at the clump, which implies a
degeneracy of their evolutionary status between subgiant/red giant branch and
core helium burning phases. The atmospheres of a large proportion of WGB stars
(more than 50%) exhibit lithium abundances A(Li) \geq 1.4 dex similar to
Li-rich K giants. The position of WGB stars along with the Li-rich K giants in
the H-R diagram however indicates that both are well separated groups. The
combined and tentatively consistent analysis of the abundance pattern for
lithium, carbon and nitrogen of WGB stars seems to indicate that carbon
underabundance could be decorrelated from the lithium and nitrogen
overabundances.

lithiation/delithiation data from multiple cycles on a Li/Si half-cell, a
methodology to separate the charge due to the main reaction
(lithiation/delithiation of Si) from the side-reaction (electrolyte-reduction)

well-cycled amorphous silicon thin-film electrodes at ambient temperature for
the following three commonly-used lithium-ion electrolyte formulations:
mixtures of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC) with and
without a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, and propylene carbonate

formulations, the electrolyte containing EC:DEC with the FEC additive exhibits
the lowest coulombic losses due to side-reactions, followed by PC, and EC:DEC
without the FEC additive (i.e., EC:DEC + FEC > PC > EC:DEC). The importance of
estimating side-reaction rates on a well-cycled electrode is discussed in the

negative-electrode during electrolyte wetting and electrochemical cycling is
measured through wafer-curvature method. Upon electrolyte addition, the
composite electrode rapidly develops compressive stress of the order of 1-2 MPa
due to binder swelling; upon continued exposure, the stress continues to evolve
towards an apparent plateau. During electrochemical intercalation at a slow
rate, the compressive stress increases with the electrode's state-of-charge,
reaching a maximum value of 10 - 12 MPa. There appears to be an approximate
correlation between the rate of stress rise and the staging behavior of the
lithiated graphite. De-intercalation at a slow rate results in a similar linear
decrease in electrode stress. Tensile stress of a few MPa develops at the end
of deintercalation in the first few cycles, after which the electrode remains
under compressive stress only. Although higher peak stresses are seen at high
C-rates, the dependence appears to be relatively weak (up to 5C). These
measurements reveal, for the first time, the nature of stress evolution in
practical lithium-ion-battery electrodes and provide useful data to quantify
the driving force for mechanical damage that accrues in composite electrodes
upon repeated cycling. While the reported results can serve as reference for
calibrating theoretical and computational models to predict electrode stress
and damage evolution, the methodology demonstrated can be used to measure
stresses and characterize fatigue damage in any composite lithium-ion-battery

  in stellar radiative interiors","  Small levels of turbulence can be present in stellar radiative interiors due
to, e.g., instability of rotational shear. In this paper we estimate turbulent
transport coefficients for stably stratified rotating stellar radiation zones.
Stable stratification induces strong anisotropy with a very small ratio of
radial-to-horizontal turbulence intensities. Angular momentum is transported
mainly due to the correlation between azimuthal and radial turbulent motions
induced by the Coriolis force. This non-diffusive transport known as the
Lambda-effect has outward direction in radius and is much more efficient
compared to the effect of radial eddy viscosity. Chemical species are
transported by small radial diffusion only. This result is confirmed using
direct numerical simulations combined with the test-scalar method. As a
consequence of the non-diffusive transport of angular momentum, the estimated
characteristic time of rotational coupling (< 100 Myr) between radiative core
and convective envelope in young solar-type stars is much shorter compared to
the time-scale of Lithium depletion (~1 Gyr).

  asymptotic giant branch stars","  A recent survey of a large sample of Galactic intermediate-mass (>3 Msun)
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars shows that they exhibit large
overabundances of rubidium (Rb) up to 100--1000 times solar. These observations
set constraints on our theoretical notion of the slow neutron capture process
(s process) that occurs inside intermediate-mass AGB stars. Lithium (Li)
abundances are also reported for these stars. In intermediate-mass AGB stars,
Li can be produced by proton captures occuring at the base of the convective
envelope. For this reason the observations of Rb, Zr, and Li set complementary
constraints on different processes occurring in the same stars. We present
predictions for the abundances of Rb, Zr, and Li as computed for the first time
simultaneously in intermediate-mass AGB star models and compare them to the
current observational constraints. We find that the Rb abundance increases with
increasing stellar mass, as is inferred from observations but we are unable to
match the highest observed [Rb/Fe] abundances. Inclusion of a partial mixing
zone (PMZ) to activate the 13C(a,n)16O reaction as an additional neutron source
yields significant enhancements in the Rb abundance. However this leads to Zr
abundances that exceed the upper limits of the current observational
constraints. If the third dredge-up (TDU) efficiency remains as high during the
final stages of AGB evolution as during the earlier stages, we can match the
lowest values of the observed Rb abundance range. We predict large variations
in the Li abundance, which are observed. Finally, the predicted Rb production
increases with decreasing metallicity, in qualitative agreement with
observations of Magellanic Cloud AGB stars. However stellar models of Z=0.008
and Z=0.004 intermediate-mass AGB stars do not produce enough Rb to match the
observed abundances.

the positive-charged graphene surface, within a limited range of surface-charge

[Al/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] abundance trends almost identically follow those of the
{\alpha}-elements, and the [Zr/Fe] ratios exhibit relatively little change with
[Fe/H]. The consistently low [La/Eu] ratios of the RGB stars indicate that at
least a majority of bulge stars formed rapidly (<1 Gyr) and before the main
s-process could become a significant pollution source. In contrast, we find
that the potential inner disk clump stars exhibit abundance patterns more
similar to those of the thin and thick disks. Comparisons between the abundance
trends at different bulge locations suggest that the inner and outer bulge
formed on similar timescales. However, we find evidence of some abundance
differences between the most metal-poor and metal-rich stars in various bulge
fields. The data also indicate that the halo may have had a more significant
impact on the outer bulge initial composition than the inner bulge composition.
The [Na/Fe] and to a lesser extent [La/Fe] abundances further indicate that the
metal-poor bulge, at least at ~1 kpc from the Galactic center, and thick disk
may not share an identical chemistry.

that the location of the silicon cluster near the graphene has higher

about a good future for the hybrid structure using for the battery anode

called ""metallicity"". A number of very metal poor stars have been found some of
which, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen. For theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of stars
with metallicities lower than Z=1.5E-5, it has been suggested that low mass
stars (M<0.8M\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form until
the interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated to
lie in the range 1.5E-8\leqZ\leq1.5E-6, although competing theories claiming
the contrary do exist. Here we report the chemical composition of a star with a
very low Z\leq6.9E-7 (4.5E-5 of that of the Sun) and a chemical pattern typical
of classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment of
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. This shows that low mass stars can be formed at
very low metallicity. Lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicity
extension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. Lithium
depletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperatures
above two million K in its history, which points to rather particular formation

halo remains an open question. Current models do not seem to give a
satisfactory explanation for the observed abundances of Lithium in the galactic
metal-poor stars and the existence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) and
Nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars. In order to deal with some of these
theoretical issues, we suggest an alternative explanation, where some of the
Pop. III SNe are followed by the detonation of their neutron stars
(Quark-Novae; QNe). In QNe occurring a few days to a few weeks following the
preceding SN explosion, the neutron-rich relativistic QN ejecta leads to
spallation of 56Ni processed in the ejecta of the preceding SN explosion and
thus to ""iron/metal impoverishment"" of the primordial gas swept by the combined
SN+QN ejecta. We show that the generation of stars formed from fragmentation of
pristine clouds swept-up by the combined SN+QN ejecta acquire a metallicity
with -7.5 < Fe/H] < -1.5 for dual explosions with 2 < t_delay (days) < 30.
Spallation leads to the depletion of 56Ni and formation of sub-Ni elements such
as Ti, V, Cr, and Mn providing a reasonable account of the trends observed in
galactic halo metal-poor stars. CEMP stars form in dual explosions with short
delays (t_delay < 5 days). These lead to important destruction of 56Ni (and
thus to a drastic reduction of the amount of Fe in the swept up cloud) while
preserving the carbon processed in the outer layers of the SN ejecta. Lithium
is produced from the interaction of the neutron-rich QN ejecta with the outer
(oxygen-rich) layers of the SN ejecta. A Lithium plateau with 2 < A(Li) < 2.4
can be produced in our model as well as a corresponding 6Li plateau with
6Li/7Li < 0.3.

-3.3 observed with VLT/UVES spectrograph. Among these 12 metal-poor stars,
there are 8 CEMP stars for which we measure or constrain the Li abundance. In

dilution permits the existence of ""Li-Spite plateau and C-rich"" stars, whereas
some of the ""Li-depleted and C-rich"" stars call for an unidentified additional
depletion mechanism that cannot be explained by dilution alone. We find
evidence that rotation is related to the Li depletion in some CEMP stars.
Additionally, we report on a newly recognized double-lined spectroscopic binary

this study. A pseudospectral method is employed for the computational
procedure. The methodology involves computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the generalized two-dimensional Hartree-Fock partial differential equations
for these two- and three-electron systems in a self-consistent manner. The
method exploits the natural symmetries of the problem without assumptions of
any basis functions for expressing the wave functions of the electrons or the
commonly employed adiabatic approximation. It is seen that the results obtained
here for a few of the most tightly bound states of each of the atoms, helium
and lithium, are in good agreement with findings elsewhere. In this regard, we
report new data for two new states of lithium that have not been studied thus
far in the literature. It is also seen that the pseudospectral method employed
here is considerably more economical, from a computational point of view, than
previously employed methods such as a finite-element based approach. The key
enabling advantage of the method described here is the short computational

The temperature dependence of the frequency suggests the origin of the

processes, and their study can help to understand the large depletion of
lithium in the Sun. Due to its age and metallicity, the open cluster M67 is
especially interesting on this regard. Many studies on lithium abundances in
M67 have already been performed, but a homogeneous global analysis of lithium
in stars from subsolar up to the most massive members, was never accomplished
for a large sample based on high-quality spectra. We tested our non-standard
models, which were calibrated using the Sun with observational data. We
collected literature data to follow, for the first time in a homogeneous way,
NLTE lithium abundances of all observed single stars in M67 more massive than
about 0.9 solar masses. Our grid of evolutionary models were computed with
non-standard mixing at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.01, using the Toulouse-Geneva
evolution code. The analysis is started from the entrance in the ZAMS. Lithium
in M67 is a tight function of mass for stars more massive than the Sun, apart
of a few outliers. A plateau in lithium abundances is observed for turn-off
stars. Both less massive and more massive stars are more depleted than those in
the plateau. There is a significant scatter in lithium abundances for any given
mass lower than M <= 1.1 solar masses. Our models qualitatively reproduce most
of the features described above, although the predicted depletion of lithium is
0.45 dex smaller than observed for masses in the plateau region, i.e. between
1.1 and 1.28 solar masses. Clearly, more work is needed to throughly match the
observations. Despite hints that chromospheric activity and rotation play a
role in lithium depletion, no firm conclusion can be drawn with the presently
available data.

  intercalation of a molecular spacer layer","  The recent discovery of high temperature superconductivity in a layered iron
arsenide has led to an intensive search to optimize the superconducting
properties of iron-based superconductors by changing the chemical composition
of the spacer layer that is inserted between adjacent anionic iron arsenide
layers. Until now, superconductivity has only been found in compounds with a
cationic spacer layer consisting of metal ions: Li+, Na+, K+, Ba2+ or a
PbO-type or perovskite-type oxide layer. Electronic doping is usually necessary
to control the fine balance between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.
Superconductivity has also been reported in FeSe, which contains neutral layers
similar in structure to those found in the iron arsenides but without the
spacer layer. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1-yFe2Se2 (x
~0.6 ; y ~ 0.2), with lithium ions, lithium amide and ammonia acting as the
spacer layer, which exhibits superconductivity at 43(1) K, higher than in any
FeSe-derived compound reported so far and four times higher at ambient pressure
than the transition temperature, Tc, of the parent Fe1.01Se. We have determined
the crystal structure using neutron powder diffraction and used magnetometry
and muon-spin rotation data to determine the superconducting properties. This
new synthetic route opens up the possibility of further exploitation of related
molecular intercalations in this and other systems in order to greatly optimize
the superconducting properties in this family.

""114"" ferrites, YBaFe4O7 and CaBaFe4O7, shows that these diamagnetic cations
play a major role in tuning the competition between ferrimagnetism and magnetic
frustration in these oxides. The substitution of Li or Zn for Fe in the cubic
phase YBaFe4O7 leads to a structural transition to a hexagonal phase
YBaFe4-xMxO7, for M = Li (0.30 < x < 0.75) and for M = Zn (0.40 < x < 1.50). It
is seen that for low doping values i.e. x = 0.30 (for Li) and x = 0.40 (for
Zn), these diamagnetic cations induce a strong ferrimagnetic component in the
samples, in contrast to the spin glass behaviour of the cubic phase. In all the
hexagonal phases, YBaFe4-xMxO7 and CaBaFe4-xMxO7 with M = Li and Zn, it is seen
that in the low doping regime (x ~ 0.3 to 0.5), the competition between
ferrimagnetism and 2 D magnetic frustration is dominated by the average valency
of iron. In contrast, in the high doping regime (x ~ 1.5), the emergence of a
spin glass is controlled by the high degree of cationic disorder, irrespective
of the iron valency.

faster than their classical counterparts, but some technical hurdles remain.
Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms
computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model.
Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary
gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of
fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates
which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional
Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, \emph{Quantum Inf.
Comput.}, \textbf{6}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error $\epsilon$,
arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a
limited set of gates in time which is $O(\log \epsilon)$ or $O(\log \log
\epsilon)$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average
depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations.
Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and
second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates
and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant
time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for
Lithium hydride.

  the need of an efficient hybrid functional approach","  In the context of the development of NMR Fermi contact shift calculations for
assisting structural characterization of battery materials, we propose an
accurate, efficient, and robust approach based on the use of an all electron
method. The full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, as
implemented in the WIEN2k code, is coupled with the use of hybrid functionals
for the evaluation of hyperfine field quantities. The WIEN2k code is able to
fully relax relativistic core states and uses an autoadaptive basis set that is
highly accurate for the determination of the hyperfine field. Furthermore, the
way hybrid functional approaches are implemented offers the possibility to use
them at no additional computational cost. In this paper, NMR Fermi contact
shifts for lithium are studied in different classes of paramagnetic materials
that present an interest in the field of Li-ion batteries: olivine LiMPO4 (M =
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), anti-NASICON type Li3M2(PO4)3 (M = Fe, V), and
antifluorite-type Li6CoO4. Making use of the possibility to apply partial
hybrid functionals either only on the magnetic atom or also on the anionic
species, we evidence the role played by oxygen atoms on polarisation
mechanisms. Our method is quite general for an application on various types of
materials.

sample of 16 candidate Extremely Metal-Poor (EMP) dwarf stars, extracted from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). There are two main purposes: in the first
place to verify the reliability of the metallicity estimates derived from the
SDSS spectra; in the second place to see if the abundance trends found for the
brighter nearer stars studied previously also hold for this sample of fainter,
more distant stars. Methods: We used the UVES at the VLT to obtain
high-resolution spectra of the programme stars. The abundances were determined
by an automatic analysis with the MyGIsFOS code, with the exception of lithium,
for which the abundances were determined from the measured equivalent widths of
the Li I resonance doublet. Results: All candidates are confirmed to be EMP
stars, with [Fe/H]<= -3.0. The chemical composition of the sample of stars is
similar to that of brighter and nearer samples. We measured the lithium
abundance for 12 stars and provide stringent upper limits for three other
stars, for a fourth star the upper limit is not significant, owing to the low
signal-to noise ratio of the spectrum. The ""meltdown"" of the Spite plateau is
confirmed, but some of the lowest metallicity stars of the sample lie on the
plateau. Conclusions: The concordance of the metallicities derived from
high-resolution spectra and those estimated from the SDSS spectra suggests that
the latter may be used to study the metallicity distribution of the halo. The
abundance pattern suggests that the halo was well mixed for all probed
metallicities and distances. The fact that at the lowest metallicities we find
stars on the Spite plateau suggests that the meltdown depends on at least
another parameter, besides metallicity. (abridged)

intriguing manifestations of quantum physics. At the same time single photons
and pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of
linear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure.
These fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological
progress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum
memories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However,
further progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different
components. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and
photon pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon
source should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength
range and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while
retaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different
wavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and
experimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair
source based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped,
monolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and
supports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric
down-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently
generated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning
over 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13
MHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.2$.
This compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different
physical quantum systems and renders it ideal for the implementation of quantum
repeaters and optical quantum information processing.

Galactic model predictions. We characterize the observed sub-sample in terms of
spectral type, lithium content, radial and rotational velocities, as well as
iron abundance. A population synthesis model is then applied to analyze the
stellar content of the RASS in the studied area. We find that stars associated
with the Orion star-forming region do show a high lithium content. A population
of late-type stars with lithium equivalent widths larger than Pleiades stars of
the same spectral type (hence younger than ~70-100 Myr) is found widely spread

identified. The spectroscopic follow-up and comparison with Galactic model
predictions reveal that the X-ray selected stellar population in the direction
of Orion is characterized by three distinct components, namely the clustered,
the young dispersed, and the widespread field populations. The clustered
population is mainly associated with regions of recent or ongoing star
formation and correlates spatially with molecular clouds. The dispersed young
population follows a broad lane apparently coinciding spatially with the Gould
Belt, while the widespread population consists primarily of active field stars
older than 100 Myr. We expect the ""bi-dimensional"" picture emerging from this
study to grow in depth as soon as the distance and the kinematics of the
studied sources will become available from the future Gaia mission.

with FLAMES at the VLT. Here, we reinvestigate the FLAMES-UVES sample of 18
stars, ranging from just above the turnoff point (TOP) to the red giant branch
below the bump. Inspired by new calibrations of the infrared flux method, we
adopt a set of hotter temperature scales. Chemical abundances are determined
for six elements (Li, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe). Signatures of cluster-internal
pollution are identified and corrected for in the analysis of Mg.
  On the modified temperature scales, evolutionary trends in the abundances of
Mg and Fe are found to be significant at the 2{\sigma} and 3{\sigma} levels,
respectively. The detailed evolution of abundances for all six elements agrees
with theoretical isochrones, calculated with effects of atomic diffusion and a
weak to moderately strong efficiency of turbulent mixing. The age of these
models is compatible with the external determination from the white dwarf
cooling sequence. We find that the abundance analysis cannot be reconciled with
the strong turbulent-mixing efficiency inferred elsewhere for halo field stars.
A weak mixing efficiency reproduces observations best, indicating a
diffusion-corrected primordial lithium abundance of log {\epsilon}(Li) = 2.57
+- 0.10. At 1.2{\sigma}, this value agrees well with WMAP-calibrated Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis predictions.

Increasing the pH of the solution from 3 to 9 reduces the adsorption by
reversing the charge of the alumina. This occurs at lower pH for the R-plane (1
-1 0 2) than the C-plane (0 0 0 1), corresponding to the different points of
zero charge. The largest surface excess is about 6.5 micromol m-2, the
thickness of the adsorbed layer is about 24 Angstrom and it contains roughly
20% water. The hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules clearly
interpenetrate rather than form an ordered bilayer. The structure is similar in
either pure water or in 0.1 M NaCl when the surfactant is at the respective
critical micelle concentration. Different structures were seen with lithium and
cesium dodecyl sulfate. The CsDS forms dense layers with little or no hydration
and a surface excess of about 10.5 micromol m-2. The metal cation strongly
influences the hydration of the adsorbed surfactant. An overall picture of

Currently, two theories for their formation have been presented. These are the
Final Flash scenario, in which a dying asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star
throws off its atmosphere to reveal the hydrogen poor, heavily processed
material underneath, and the double degenerate scenario, in which two white
dwarfs merge to produce a new star with renewed vigour. Some theories predict
that the temperatures reached during the latter scenario would destroy any
lithium originally present in the white dwarfs. The observed lithium content of
some R Coronae Borealis stars, therefore, is often interpreted as an indication
that the Final Flash scenario best describes their formation. In this paper, it
is shown that lithium production can, indeed, occur in the merging of a helium
white dwarf with a carbon-oxygen white dwarf if their chemical composition,
particularly that of 3He, is fully considered. The production mechanism is
described in detail, and the sensitivity of lithium production to the merger
environment is investigated. Nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations of
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) tracer particles are performed to show
that any lithium produced in these environments will be concentrated towards
the cloud of material surrounding the R CrB star. Measurements of the lithium
content of these clouds would, therefore, provide a valuable insight into the
formation mechanism of R CrB stars.

belonging to two halo populations of F and G main-sequence stars previously
found to differ in [alpha/Fe] for the metallicity range -1.4 < [Fe/H] < -0.7.
Li abundances are derived from the LiI 6707.8 A line measured in
high-resolution spectra using MARCS model atmospheres. Furthermore, masses of
the stars are determined from the logTeff - logg diagram by interpolating
between Yonsei-Yale evolutionary tracks. There is no significant systematic
difference in the lithium abundances of high- and low-alpha halo stars. For the
large majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass
fractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation
A(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.
Extrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the
primordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations
and the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars
with [Fe/H] < -1.5. We suggest that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a Li
abundance close to the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres
has been depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar
mass and Z. The lack of a systematic difference in the Li abundances of high-

the destruction of lithium.

were observed by the NASA Kepler mission. The stellar parameters (vsini,
spectral type, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) were derived from optical spectroscopy
which allowed us also to study the chromospheric activity from the emission in
the core of H\alpha\ and CaII IRT lines. The high-precision Kepler photometric
data spanning over 229 days were then fitted with a robust spot model. Model
selection and parameter estimation are performed in a Bayesian manner, using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Both stars came out to be Sun-like with an age
of about 100-200 Myr, based on their lithium content and kinematics. Their
youth is confirmed by the high level of chromospheric activity, comparable to
that displayed by the early G-type stars in the Pleiades cluster. The flux
ratio of the CaII-IRT lines suggests that the cores of these lines are mainly
formed in optically-thick regions analogous to solar plages. The model of the
light curves requires at least seven enduring spots for KIC 7985370 and nine
spots for KIC 7765135 for a satisfactory fit. The assumption of longevity of
the star spots, whose area is allowed to evolve in time, is at the heart of our
approach. We found, for both stars, a rather high value of the equator-to-pole
differential rotation (d\Omega~0.18 rad/day) which is in contrast with the
predictions of some mean-field models of differential rotation for
fast-rotating stars. Our results are instead in agreement with previous works
on solar-type stars and with other models which predict a higher latitudinal
shear, increasing with equatorial angular velocity.

fragments into Earth-mass planets in trillion-planet

pristine, frictionally-merging, gas-planets within the gently stressed clumps
of the early universe, burning most available lithium in brown-dwarfs and
hot-stars before creating metals that permit cooler burning. The Caffau halo
star is a present day example. CDM first stars (Population III) were massive
and promptly exploded, reionizing the gas of the universe and seeding it with
metals, thus making the observed star unexplainable. From HGD, CDM and its
massive first stars, and re-ionization by Pop III supernovae, never happened.

  second lithium problem?","  The presence of 6Li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usually
inferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the
7Li doublet line at 670.8 nm. However, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused by
convective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishable
from the asymmetry produced by a weak 6Li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7Li
profile. Previous determinations of the 6Li/ 7Li isotopic ratio based on 1D
model atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, must
therefore be considered as upper limits. By comparing synthetic 1D LTE and 3D
non-LTE line profiles of the Li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differential
effect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance as a
function of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. As expected, we
find that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6Li/7Li
ratios. Depending on the stellar parameters, the 3D-1D offset in 6Li/7Li ranges
between -0.005 and -0.020. When this purely theoretical correction is taken
into account for the Asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant
6Li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3
sigma criterion).
  We also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, high
S/N spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the ""second
Lithium problem"" actually disappears when accounting properly for convection
and non-LTE line formation in 3D stellar atmospheres. Out of 8 stars, HD84937
seems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6Li. In view of our
results, the existence of a 6Li plateau appears questionable.

depletion of pre-main sequence (PMS) solar-type stars. Methods: The impact of
rotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium
abundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models
that include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of
the disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS
rotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase
between 3 and 9 Myr. Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the
PMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of
the lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work.
This results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models
compared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the
stellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to
differential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing
results in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited
contribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium
depletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation
on PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the
disc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance
of a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational
mixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and
lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the
zero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast
rotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.

lithium abundance (A_Li) plane is observed such that no stars with Teff~6075 K
and A_Li~1.8 are found. We speculate that most of the stars on the low A_Li
side of the desert have experienced a short-lived period of severe surface
lithium destruction as main-sequence or subgiant stars. Next, we search for
differences in the lithium content of thin-disk and thick-disk stars, but we
find that internal processes have erased from the stellar photospheres their
possibly different histories of lithium enrichment. Nevertheless, we note that
the maximum lithium abundance of thick-disk stars is nearly constant from
[Fe/H]=-1.0 to -0.1, at a value that is similar to that measured in very
metal-poor halo stars (A_Li~2.2). Finally, differences in the lithium abundance
distribution of known planet-host stars relative to otherwise ordinary stars
appear when restricting the samples to narrow ranges of Teff or mass, but they
are fully explained by age and metallicity biases. We confirm the lack of a
connection between low lithium abundance and planets. However, we find that no
low A_Li planet-hosts are found in the desert Teff window. Provided that subtle
sample biases are not responsible for this observation, this suggests that the
presence of gas giant planets inhibit the mechanism responsible for the lithium
desert.

processing. Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar
environments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different
models proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the
observed O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple
populations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the
nuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,
diluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The
lithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to
the lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical
patterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which
processed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine
the predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple
populations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the
ejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our
models can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium
yields predicted by recent super--AGB models. We show that the super--AGB
yields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue
main sequence stars in wCen and/or NGC2808. In addition, we examine the
different model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either the
Big Bang abundance predicted by the standard models (A(Li)=2.6-2.7), or the
abundance detected at the surface of population II stars (A(Li)=2.2-2.3). Once
a chemical model is well constrained, the O--Li distribution could perhaps be
used to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance.

to study the electrocaloric effect (ECE) in lithium niobate, LiNbO$_3$, and
find a giant electrocaloric effect along a line passing through the
ferroelectric transition. With applied electric field, a line of maximum ECE
passes through the zero field ferroelectric transition, continuing along a
Widom line at high temperatures with increasing field, and along the
instability that leads to homogeneous ferroelectric switching below $T_c$ with
an applied field antiparallel to the spontaneous polarization. This line is
defined as the minimum in the inverse capacitance under applied electric field.
We investigate the effects of pressure, temperature and applied electric field
on the ECE. The behavior we observe in LiNbO$_3$ should generally apply to
ferroelectrics; we therefore suggest that the operating temperature for
refrigeration and energy scavenging applications should be above the
ferroelectric transition region to obtain large electrocaloric response. We
find a relationship among $T_c$, the Widom line and homogeneous switching that
should be universal among ferroelectrics, relaxors, multiferroics, and the same
behavior should be found under applied magnetic fields in ferromagnets.

the core could be braked quickly to an extremely long spin period by the

could be disrupted by some powerful bursts or exhausted via stellar wind. If
the envelope is disrupted after the core has spun down, the core will become an
extremely long-period compact object, with a slow proper motion speed,
surrounded by a supernova-remnant-like shell. These features all agree with the
observations of 1E161348-5055. TZOs are expected to have produced extraordinary

as the Spite plateau) is a factor of $\sim 3-5$ lower than the predictions of
the standard cosmology. Since the observations are limited to the local
Universe (halo stars, globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way) it is
possible that certain physical processes may have led to the spatial separation
of lithium and local reduction of [Li/H]. We study the question of lithium
diffusion after the cosmological recombination in sub-Jeans dark matter haloes,
taking into account that more than 95% of lithium remains in the singly-ionized
state at all times. Large scattering cross sections on the rest of the ionized
gas leads to strong coupling of lithium to protons and its initial direction of
diffusion coincides with that of H$^+$. In the rest frame of the neutral gas
this leads to the diffusion of H$^+$ and Li$^+$ out of overdensities with the
trend of reducing [Li/H] in the minima of gravitational wells relative to the
primordial value. We quantify this process and argue that, with certain
qualifications, it may have played a significant role in creating local lithium
deficiency within the primordial dark matter haloes, comparable to those
observed along the Spite plateau.

  Rotation and Light Element Replenishment","  The orbital angular momentum of a close-orbiting giant planet can be
sufficiently large that, if transferred to the envelope of the host star during
the red giant branch (RGB) evolution, it can spin-up the star's rotation to
unusually large speeds. This spin-up mechanism is one possible explanation for
the rapid rotators detected among the population of generally slow-rotating red
giant stars. These rapid rotators thus comprise a unique stellar sample
suitable for searching for signatures of planet accretion in the form of
unusual stellar abundances due to the dissemination of the accreted planet in
the stellar envelope. In this study, we look for signatures of replenishment in
the Li abundances and (to a lesser extent) 12C/13C, which are both normally
lowered during RGB evolution. Accurate abundances were measured from high
signal-to-noise echelle spectra for samples of both slow and rapid rotator red
giant stars. We find that the rapid rotators are on average enriched in lithium
compared to the slow rotators, but both groups of stars have identical
distributions of 12C/13C within our measurement precision. Both of these
abundance results are consistent with the accretion of planets of only a few

most Li-rich stars in our sample---particularly Li regeneration during various

non-standard abundances even at early RGB stages, suggesting that initial
protostellar Li abundances and 12C/13C may be more variable than originally
thought.

that of thermal density functional theory using both ground-state and
temperature-dependent approximate exchange functionals. The test system is bcc
Li in the temperature-density regime of warm dense matter (WDM). In this

Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics studies of WDM with ground-state

equivalent to high density bulk Li, we determine the density ranges for which
standard projector augmented wave (PAW) and norm-conserving pseudopotentials

  a thicker atmosphere and liquid water","  Lithium is overabundant in cosmic rays because protons impact on carbon and
oxygen nuclei and fission them. Among the products of this fission is lithium.
Given this preference for carbon and oxygen atoms, in this work I propose that
in an atmosphere of almost pure CO2, such as Mars and Venus atmospheres,
lithium nuclei are produced by interaction with cosmic rays. I calculated the
production rate of lithium and came to the conclusion that, for pressures of
two bars or greater, are produced between 21 and 81 lithium nuclei for each
primary cosmic rays proton. For lower pressures, the production is less and
almost nil with the current pressure of Mars or Earth (pressure of CO2).
Assuming a rate of cosmic ray arrival at Mars equal to that of Earth, and a
pressure greater than two bars throughout the history of Mars, the amount of
lithium that would occur would be between 162 and 642 million metric tons (in
the Earth lithium estimated reserves are 30 million metric tons). These values
are an upper limit; the actual amount of lithium on Mars will depend on the
time in which the planet had a dense atmosphere (> 2 bars). That is, the amount
of lithium produced by cosmic rays, serves to estimate the time that Mars had a
thick atmosphere and therefore the capacity for have liquid water on surface.

Orbital solutions are presented for 26 SB2 and 19 SB1 systems with
unprecedented phase coverage and accuracy. The total of 6,609 R=55,000 echelle
spectra are also used to systematically determine effective temperatures,
gravities, metallicities, rotational velocities, lithium abundances and
absolute H{\alpha}-core fluxes as a function of time. The photometry is used to
infer unspotted brightness, V - I and/or b - y colors, spot-induced brightness
amplitudes and precise rotation periods. Our data are complemented by
literature data and are used to determine rotation-temperature-activity
relations for active binary components. We also relate lithium abundance to
rotation and surface temperature. We find that 74% of all known
rapidly-rotating active binary stars are synchronized and in circular orbits
but 26% are rotating asynchronously of which half have Prot > Porb and e > 0.
Because rotational synchronization is predicted to occur before orbital
circularization active binaries should undergo an extra spin-down besides tidal
dissipation. We suspect this to be due to a magnetically channeled wind with
its subsequent braking torque. We find a steep increase of rotation period with
decreasing effective temperature for active stars. For inactive, single giants
with Prot > 100 d, the relation is much weaker. Our data also indicate a
period-activity relation for H{\alpha} of the form RH{\alpha} \propto P - 0.24
for binaries and RH{\alpha} \propto P -0.14 for singles. Lithium abundances in
our sample increase with effective temperature. On average, binaries of
comparable effective temperature appear to exhibit 0.25 dex less surface
lithium than singles. We also find a trend of increased Li abundance with
rotational period of form log n(Li) \propto - 0.6 log Prot.

main-sequence stars. We present new evolution calculations for these

He-sdO's develop a strong helium-burning shell and evolve to become helium-rich

the latter, in addition to the CO+He white dwarf merger and the very-late
thermal pulse channels proposed previously. We confirm a recent suggestion that

of nearby young kinematic groups. The analysis minimally takes into account the
position, proper motion, magnitude and color of a star, but other observables
can be readily added (e.g. radial velocity, distance). We use this method to
find new young low-mass stars in the \beta Pictoris (\beta PMG) and AB Doradus
(ABDMG) moving groups and in the TW Hydrae (TWA), Tucana-Horologium (THA),
Columba, Carina and Argus associations. Starting from a sample of 758 mid-KM
(K5V-M5V) stars showing youth indicators such as H\alpha\ and X-ray emission,
our analysis yields 215 new highly probable low-mass members of the kinematic
groups analyzed. One is in TWA, 37 in \beta PMG, 17 in THA, 20 in Columba, 6 in
Carina, 50 in Argus, 33 in ABDMG, and the remaining 51 candidates are likely
young but have an ambiguous membership to more than one association. The false
alarm rate for new candidates is estimated to be 5% for \beta PMG and TWA, 10%
for THA, Columba, Carina and Argus, and 14% for ABDMG. Our analysis confirms
the membership of 58 stars proposed in the literature. Firm membership
confirmation of our new candidates will require measurement of their radial
velocity (predicted by our analysis), parallax and lithium 6708 {\AA}
equivalent width. We have initiated these follow-up observations for a number
of candidates and we have identified two stars (2MASSJ0111+1526,
2MASSJ0524-1601) as very strong candidate members of the \beta PMG and one
strong candidate member (2MASSJ0533-5117) of the THA; these three stars have
radial velocity measurements confirming their membership and lithium detections
consistent with young age. Finally, we proposed that six stars should be
considered as new bona fide members of \beta PMG and ABDMG, one of which being
first identified in this work, the others being known candidates from the
literature.

groups AB Doradus, Carina Near, and Ursa Major. The exoplanet-host star \iota

  The three young associations have lithium abundance consistent with their
age. All other elements show solar abundances. The three groups are
characterised by a small scatter in all abundances, with mean [Fe/H] values of
0.10 (\sigma=0.03), 0.08 (\sigma=0.05), and 0.01 (\sigma=0.03) dex for AB
Doradus, Carina Near, and Ursa Major, respectively. The distribution of
elemental abundances appears congruent with the chemical pattern of the
Galactic thin disc in the solar vicinity, as found for other young groups. This
means that the metallicity distribution of nearby young stars, targets of
direct-imaging planet-search surveys, is different from that of old, field
solar-type stars, i.e. the typical targets of radial velocity surveys.
  The young planet-host star \iota Horologii shows a lithium abundance lower
than that found for the young association members. It is found to have a
slightly super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H]=0.16+-0.09), while all [X/Fe]
ratios are similar to the solar values. Its elemental abundances are close to
those of the Hyades cluster derived from the literature, which seems to
reinforce the idea of a possible common origin with the primordial cluster.

dozens of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the young sigma Orionis open
cluster without detailed spectroscopic characterisation. Aims. We look for

low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in sigma Orionis with OSIRIS at the Gran
Telescopio Canarias under very poor weather conditions. These objects display
variability in the optical, infrared, Halpha, and/or X-rays on time scales of
hours to years. We complemented our spectra with optical and near-/mid-infrared
photometry. Results. For seven targets, we detected lithium in absorption,
identified Halpha, the calcium doublet, and forbidden lines in emission, and/or
determined spectral types for the first time. We characterise in detail a
faint, T Tauri-like brown dwarf with an 18 h-period variability in the optical
and a large Halpha equivalent width of -125+/-15 AA, as well as two M1-type,
X-ray-flaring, low-mass stars, one with a warm disc and forbidden emission

cluster NGC 6253 ([Fe/H]=+0.43+/-0.01) has been used to study the stellar
lithium (Li) abundances near the cluster's turnoff. NGC 6253 greatly expands
the range of [Fe/H] for clusters that have a Li abundance analysis. This is
important for studying the complicated effects of, and potential correlations
with, stellar Fe abundance on surface Li abundance. Comparisons to the younger
and less-metal-rich Hyades and to the similarly-aged but solar-metallicity M67
show that NGC 6253's Li abundances are qualitatively consistent with the
prediction, from Standard Stellar Evolution Theory, that higher-metallicity
stars have a greater Li depletion. Comparison with M67 provides evidence that
the more-metal-rich NGC 6253 had a higher initial Li, which is consistent with
expectations from models of Galactic Li production. NGC 6253 is also compared
to the intermediate-aged NGC 3680, NGC 752, and IC 4651 open clusters.
Comparison of the Li-gap positions in all six clusters shows: a) the gap's
position in Teff is independent of metallicity, but b) higher-metallicity
clusters have their gaps in higher-mass stars. In addition, the Li gap's
position is shown not to evolve with age, which provides an important
constraint for the non-standard depletion mechanisms that may create the Li
gap.

  ion batteries: first principles modeling and experimental studies","  Passivating lithium ion battery electrode surfaces to prevent electrolyte
decomposition is critical for battery operations. Recent work on conformal
atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating of anodes and cathodes has shown
significant technological promise. ALD further provides well-characterized
model platforms for understanding electrolyte decomposition initiated by
electron tunneling through a passivating layer. First principles calculations
reveal two regimes of electron transfer to adsorbed ethylene carbonate
molecules (EC, a main component of commercial electrolyte) depending on whether
the electrode is alumina-coated. On bare Li metal electrode surfaces, EC
accepts electrons and decomposes within picoseconds. In contrast, constrained
density functional theory calculations in an ultra-high vacuum setting show
that, with the oxide coating, e- tunneling to the adsorbed EC falls within the
non-adiabatic regime. Here the molecular reorganization energy, computed in the
harmonic approximation, plays a key role in slowing down electron transfer. Ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations conducted at liquid EC-electrode
interfaces are consistent with the view that reactions and electron transfer
occur right at the interface. Microgravimetric measurements demonstrate that
the ALD coating decreases electrolyte decomposition and corroborate the
theoretical predictions.

good fit is obtained with pre-main-sequence isochrones indicating ages between
7.5 and 15Myr. The molecular cloud mass, derived from the integrated 12CO(1-0)
emission, is 160Mo (for a distance of 120pc), much smaller than the virial mass
(10^3Mo), and the cloud is not gravitationally bound. Nor are the individual

weakness or absence of the H-alpha emission, the absence of other emission
lines, and the lack of clear LiI absorption, the targets are not T Tauri stars.

lithium in their spectra. Based on the derived distances (60-250pc), some of
the stars may lie inside the molecular cloud (120-150pc). From the fact that

  Accelerated Aging and Lifetime Prediction","  Cycle life is critically important in applications of rechargeable batteries,
but lifetime prediction is mostly based on empirical trends, rather than
mathematical models. In practical lithium-ion batteries, capacity fade occurs
over thousands of cycles, limited by slow electrochemical processes, such as
the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative
electrode, which compete with reversible lithium intercalation. Focusing on SEI
growth as the canonical degradation mechanism, we show that a simple
single-particle model can accurately explain experimentally observed capacity
fade in commercial cells with graphite anodes, and predict future fade based on
limited accelerated aging data for short times and elevated temperatures. The
theory is extended to porous electrodes, predicting that SEI growth is
essentially homogeneous throughout the electrode, even at high rates. The
lifetime distribution for a sample of batteries is found to be consistent with
Gaussian statistics, as predicted by the single-particle model. We also extend
the theory to rapidly degrading anodes, such as nanostructured silicon, which
exhibit large expansion on ion intercalation. In such cases, large area changes
during cycling promote SEI loss and faster SEI growth. Our simple models are
able to accurately fit a variety of published experimental data for graphite
and silicon anodes.

lithium abundance in stars is a long-standing problem, which indicates that the
adopted physical treatment is still lacking in some points. However, thanks to
the recent improvements in both models and observations, it is interesting to
analyse the situation to evaluate present uncertainties. We present a
consistent and quantitative analysis of the theoretical uncertainties affecting
surface lithium abundance in the current generation of models. By means of an
up-to-date and well tested evolutionary code, FRANEC, theoretical errors on
surface 7Li abundance predictions, during the pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and
main sequence (MS) phases, are discussed in detail. Then, the predicted surface
7Li abundance was tested against observational data for five open clusters,
namely Ic 2602, \alpha Per, Blanco1, Pleiades, and Ngc 2516, and for four
detached double-lined eclipsing binary systems. Stellar models for the
aforementioned clusters were computed by adopting suitable chemical
composition, age, and mixing length parameter for MS stars determined from the
analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram of each cluster. We restricted our
analysis to young clusters, to avoid additional uncertainty sources such as
diffusion and/or radiative levitation efficiency. We confirm the disagreement,
within present uncertainties, between theoretical predictions and 7Li
observations for standard models. However, we notice that a satisfactory
agreement with observations for 7Li abundance in both young open clusters and
binary systems can be achieved if a lower convection efficiency is adopted
during the pre-MS phase with respect to the MS one.

exact summation method. The theory is asymptotically exact in the field domain
below Li-donor ionization threshold, relevant to the Stark-tuning electron spin
resonance experiments. To obtain the generalized Stark susceptibilities at
arbitrary fields, we propose a new variational wave function which reproduces
the exact results in the low-field limit. With the calculated susceptibilities
at hand, we are able to predict and analyze several important physical effects.
First, we observe that the energy level shifts due to the quadratic Stark
effect for Li donors in Si are equivalent to, and can be mapped onto, those
produced by an external stress.
  Second, we demonstrate that the Stark effect anisotropy, combined with the
unique valley-orbit splitting of a Li donor in Si, spin-orbit interaction and
specially tuned external stress, may lead to a very strong modulation of the
donor spin $g$-factor by the electric field. Third, we investigate the
influence of random strains on the $g$-factor shifts and quantify the random
strain limits and requirements to Si material purity necessary to observe the

from half-cell experiments, where the influences of the working electrode
porosity and the counter electrode contribute nonlinearly to the
electrochemical re-sponse. Therefore, thin-layer electrodes of circa 1 {\mu}m
thickness were prepared with standard, highly crystalline graphite particles to
evaluate their rate capability. The performance was evaluated based on the
different stage transitions. We found that the tran-sitions towards the dense
stages 1 and 2 with LiC6 in-plane densi-ty are one of the main rate limitations
for charge and discharge. But surprisingly, the transitions towards the dilute
stages 2L, 3L, 4L, and 1L progress very fast and can even compensate for the
initial diffusion limitations of the dense stage transitions during discharge.
We show the existence of a substantial difference between the diffusion
coefficients of the liquid-like stages and the dense stages. We also
demonstrate that graphite can be charged at a rate of ~6C (10 min) and
discharged at 600C (6 s) while maintaining 80 % of the total specific charge
for particles of 3.3 {\mu}m median diameter. Based on these findings, we
propose a shrinking annuli mechanism which describes the propagation of the
different stages in the particle at medium and high rates. Besides the limited
applicable overpotential during charge, this mechanism can explain the
long-known but as yet unexplained asymmetry between the charge and discharge
rate performance of lithium intercalation in graphite.

Uncertainties related to the destruction of lithium in stars can be
circumvented if lithium abundance is measured in the ""pristine"" gas of the low

resolution of the lithium problem, we here draw attention to the possibility of
another post-BBN production channel of lithium, which could present an
important addition to the observed SMC lithium abundance. Besides standard
galactic cosmic rays, additional post-BBN production of lithium might come from

which demonstrated that these materials display an enhanced lithium mobility
relative to their binary counterpart PEO/LiTFSI. In order to grasp the
underlying microscopic scenario giving rise to these observations, we employ an
analytical, Rouse-based cation transport model [Maitra at al., PRL 2007, 98,
227802], which has originally been devised for conventional polymer
electrolytes. This model describes the cation transport via three different
mechanisms, each characterized by an individual time scale. It turns out that
also in the ternary electrolytes essentially all lithium ions are coordinated
by PEO chains, thus ruling out a transport mechanism enhanced by the presence
of ionic-liquid molecules. Rather, the plasticizing effect of the ionic liquid
contributes to the increased lithium mobility by enhancing the dynamics of the
PEO chains and consequently also the motion of the attached ions. Additional
focus is laid on the prediction of lithium diffusion coefficients from the
simulation data for various chain lengths and the comparison with experimental
data, thus demonstrating the broad applicability of our approach.

  Polymer Electrolytes - The Critical Role of the Segmental Mobility","  We present an extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the
lithium ion transport in ternary polymer electrolytes consisting of
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI)
and the ionic liquid N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (PYR13TFSI). In particular, we focus on two
different strategies by which the ternary electrolytes can be devised, namely
by (a) adding the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI, and (b) substituting the PEO
chains in PEO20LiTFSI by the ionic liquid. In order to grasp the changes of the
overall lithium transport mechanism, we employ an analytical, Rouse-based
cation transport model (Maitra et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 98, 227802),
which has originally been devised for binary PEO-based electrolytes. This model
distinguishes three different microscopic transport mechanisms, each quantified
by an individual time scale. In the course of our analysis, we extend this
mathematical description to account for an entirely new transport mechanism,
namely the TFSI-supported diffusion of lithium ions decoupled from the PEO
chains, which emerges for certain stoichiometries. We find that the segmental
mobility plays a decisive role in PEO-based polymer electrolytes. That is,
whereas the addition of the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI plasticizes the polymer
network and thus also increases the lithium diffusion, the amount of free,
mobile ether oxygens reduces when substituting the PEO chains by the ionic
liquid, which compensates the plasticizing effect. In total, our observations
allow us to formulate some general principles about the lithium ion transport
mechanism in ternary polymer electrolytes. Moreover, our insights also shed
light on recent experimental observations (Joost et al., Electrochim. Acta,
2012, 86, 330).

the pregalactic gas can now be followed with accuracy limited only by the
uncertainties on the reaction rates. Starting during the recombination era, the
formation of the first molecules and molecular ions containing hydrogen,
deuterium, helium, and lithium was severely hindered by the low density of the
expanding universe, the intensity of the cosmic radiation field, and the
absence of solid catalyzers. Molecular hydrogen and deuterated hydrogen, the
most abundant species formed in the gas phase prior to structure formation,
played a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas clouds that gave birth to
the first stellar generation, contributing to determine the scale of
fragmentation. Primordial molecules also interacted with the photons of the
cosmic background via resonant scattering, absorption and emission. In this
review we examine the current status of the chemistry of the early universe and
discuss the most relevant reactions for which uncertainties still exist from

the unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT

oscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible
stellar models for a given set of classical observations. In this work, we have
characterized two relatively faint stars, KIC10920273 and KIC11395018, using
oscillation data from Kepler photometry and atmospheric constraints from
ground-based spectroscopy. Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties;
however, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we
have determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision
compared to that of earlier results. We found that both stars have left the
main sequence and characterized them as follows: KIC10920273 is a
one-solar-mass star (M=1.00 +/- 0.04 M_sun), but much older than our Sun
(t=7.12 +/- 0.47 Gyr), while KIC11395018 is significantly more massive than the
Sun (M=1.27 +/- 0.04 M_sun) with an age close to that of the Sun (t=4.57 +/-
0.23 Gyr). We confirm that the high lithium abundance reported for these stars
should not be considered to represent young ages, as we precisely determined
them to be evolved subgiants. We discuss the use of surface lithium abundance,
rotation and activity relations as potential age diagnostics.

  giants","  We present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis of the
resonance doublet Li I at 6707.8 A for 55 Galactic F and G supergiants and
bright giants. The derived lithium abundances log \epsilon(Li) may be
considered in three groups, namely: (i) 10 Li-rich giants with log \epsilon(Li)
= 2.0-3.2 (all 10 are F-type or A9 stars); (ii) 13 G- to K0-type stars with Li
abundances in the narrow range log \epsilon(Li) = 1.1-1.8; (iii) all other
stars provide just upper limits to the Li abundance.
  The derived Li abundances are compared with theoretical predictions of 2-15
Msun stars. Our results are generally in good agreement with theory. In
particular, the absence of detectable lithium for the majority of programme
stars is explainable. The comparison suggests that the stars may be separated
by mass M into two groups, namely M < 6 Msun and M > 6 Msun. All Li-rich giants
and supergiants with log \epsilon(Li) > 2.0 have masses M < 6 Msun; 11 of 13
stars with log \epsilon(Li) = 1.1-1.8, specifically the stars with M < 6 Msun,
show good agreement with the post-first dredge-up surface abundance log
\epsilon(Li) = 1.4 predicted for the non-rotating 2-6 Msun stellar models. An
absence of Li-rich stars in the range M > 6 Msun agrees with the theoretical
prediction that F and G supergiants and giants with M > 6 Msun cannot show
detectable lithium.
  We note that present theory appears unable to account for the derived Li
abundances for some stars, namely for (i) a few relatively low-mass Li-rich
giants (M < 6 Msun), whose high Li abundances accompanied by rather high
rotational velocities or substantial nitrogen excess contradict theoretical
predictions; (ii) the relatively high-mass supergiants HR 461 and HR 8313 (M >
6 Msun) with the detected abundances log \epsilon = 1.3-1.5. It is possible
that the lithium in such stars was synthesized recently.

obtained with the X-Shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope, include

km/s), rotational velocity (v sin(i) = 20 +- 5 km/s) and lithium equivalent
width (W_Li = 430 +- 20 mAA) for FUTau A. From the rotational velocity and the
published period we infer a disk inclination of i ~ 50^deg. The lithium content
is much lower than theoretically expected for such a young very low mass
object, adding another puzzling feature to this object's properties. We
determine the mass accretion rate of FU Tau A from comparison of the
luminosities of 24 emission lines to empirical calibrations from the literature
and find a mean of log (dM/dt)_acc [M_sun/yr] = -9.9 +- 0.2. The accretion rate
determined independently from modeling of the excess emission in the Balmer and
Paschen continua is consistent with this value. The corresponding accretion
luminosity is too small to make a significant contribution to the bolometric
luminosity. The existence of an outflow in FU Tau A is demonstrated through the
first detection of forbidden emission lines from which we obtain an estimate
for the mass loss rate, log (dM/dt)_out [M_sun/yr] < -10.4. The mass outflow
and inflow rates can be combined to yield (dM/dt)_out / (dM/dt)_acc ~ 0.3, a
value that is in agreement with jet launching models.

calculate all the unique Li-site occupation configurations in a unit cell to
obtain the total energies and the most stable structures for various
compositions. Thermodynamic analysis shows that Li0.5Ni0.5Mn1.5O4 with x = 0.5

0.1 eV for 0 < x < 0.5, but is distinctly higher for 0.5 < x < 1. The
decomposition energy reaches 0.39 eV at x = 0.75. The ratios of the structures
at room temperature are calculated from Boltzmann factors by using the energy
differences between structures. The crystal structure of the unit cell changes
gradually from x = 0 to 0.5, but changes markedly from x = 0.5 to 1. This
first-principles study provides a general evaluation of the variation in the

  planet-hosting stars","  Our understanding of magnetic fields in late-type stars is strongly driven by
what we know of the solar magnetic field. For this reason, it is crucial to
understand how typical the solar dynamo is. To do this we need to compare the
solar magnetic field with that of other stars as similar to the Sun as
possible, both in stellar parameters and age, hence activity. We present here
the detection of a magnetic field in three planet-hosting solar-like stars
having a mass, age, and activity level comparable to that of the Sun. We used
the HARPSpol spectropolarimeter to obtain high-resolution high-quality
circularly polarised spectra of HD 70642, HD 117207, and HD 154088, using the
Least-Squares Deconvolution technique to detect the magnetic field. From the
Stokes I spectra, we calculated the logR activity index for each star. We
compared the position of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to
evolutionary tracks, to estimate their mass and age. We used the lithium
abundance, derived from the Stokes I spectra, to further constrain the ages. We
obtained a definite magnetic field detection for both HD 70642 and HD 154088,
while for HD 117207 we obtained a marginal detection. Due to the lower
signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we were unable to detect the
magnetic field in the second set of observations available for HD 117207 and HD
154088. On the basis of effective temperature, mass, age, and activity level
the three stars can be considered solar analogs. HD 70642, HD 117207, and HD
154088 are ideal targets for a comparative study between the solar magnetic
field and that of solar analogs.

states between light and matter, are central to the development of quantum
repeaters, quantum networks, and linear optics quantum computing. Significant
progress has been reported in recent years, including the faithful transfer of
quantum information from photons in pure and entangled qubit states. However,
none of these demonstrations confirm that photons stored in and recalled from
quantum memories remain suitable for two-photon interference measurements, such
as C-NOT gates and Bell-state measurements, which constitute another key

Bell-state measurement after either none, one, or both pulses have been
reversibly mapped to separate thulium-doped titanium-indiffused lithium niobate
(Ti:Tm:LiNbO3) waveguides. As the interference is always near the theoretical
maximum, we conclude that our solid-state quantum memories, in addition to
faithfully mapping quantum information, also preserves the entire photonic
wavefunction. Hence, we demonstrate that our memories are generally suitable
for use in advanced applications of quantum information processing that require
two-photon interference.

The low C/Fe ratio distinguishes this object from most other extremely metal
poor stars. The effective temperature and surface gravity have been determined
to be Teff = 5811 plus/minus 150 K and log g = 4.0 plus/minus 0.5. The surface
gravity estimate is problematical in that it places the star between the main
sequence and the subgiants in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. If it is assumed
that the star is on the main sequence, its mass and are estimated to be M =
0.72 plus/minus 0.06 Msun and L = 0.45 plus/minus 0.10 Lsun, placing it at a
distance of 1.35 plus/minus 0.16 kpc. The upper limit on the lithium abundance,
A(Li) < 0.9, is inconsistent with the star being a dwarf, assuming that mixing
is due only to convection. In this paper, we propose that SJ102915 is a
sub-giant that formed with significantly higher Z than currently observed, in
agreement with theoretical predictions for the minimum C and/or O abundances
needed for low mass star formation. In this scenario, extremely low Z and low
Li abundance result from gravitational settling on the main sequence followed
by incomplete convective dredge-up during subgiant evolution. The observed Fe
abundance requires the initial Fe abundance to be enhanced compared to C and O,
which we interpret as formation of SJ102915 occurring in the vicinity of a type
Ia supernova.

include phase-matching in birefringent crystal and quasi-phase-matching (QPM)
in crystal with periodically poled domains. However, these methods are not
feasible in some isotropic materials (e.g. fused silica and photosensitive
silicate glass). It was known that volume-grating in isotropic materials can
independently generate frequency-converted waves. One of disadvantages of
single-layer volume-grating is that the brightness of harmonic emission can not
be enhanced by increasing the grating thickness. In this paper, a THG device
with stratified sub-gratings was designed to enhance THG in isotropic
materials: several sub-gratings were arranged parallel, and the grating-figures
misalignment between neighboring sub-gratings was pre-fabricated. In terms of
extension of interaction length in THG, our multi-layer sub-grating is formally
equivalent to the multi-layer periodically poled crystal (e.g. lithium niobate)
in conventional QPM approach. According to the calculation results, the N-layer

the stellar interiors, for understanding the chemical evolution of the Galaxy
and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The study of Li in stars of open clusters
(hereafter OC) allows a detailed comparison with stellar evolutionary models
and permits us to trace its galactic evolution. The OC NGC 2243 is particularly
interesting because of its low metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$ dex). We
measure the iron and lithium abundance in stars of the metal-poor OC NGC 2243.
The first aim is to determine whether the Li dip extends to such low
metallicities, the second is to compare the results of our Li analysis in this
OC with those present in 47 Tuc, a globular cluster of similar metallicity. We
performed a detailed analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with the
multi-object facility FLAMES at the ESO VLT 8.2m telescope. Lithium abundance
was derived through line equivalent widths and the OSMARCS atmosphere models.
We determine a Li dip center of 1.06 $M_\odot$, which is much smaller than that
observed in solar metallicity and metal-rich clusters. This finding confirms
and strengthens the conclusion that the mass of the stars in the Li dip
strongly depends on stellar metallicity. The mean Li abundance of the cluster
is $\log n{\rm (Li)}=2.70$ dex, which is substantially higher than that
observed in 47 Tuc. We estimated an iron abundance of [Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$
dex for NGC 2243, which is similar (within the errors) to previous findings.
The [$ \alpha$/Fe] content ranges from $0.00\pm0.14$ for Ca to $0.20\pm0.22$

rotation rate and Alfv\'en frequency of the field are of the same order, almost
independent of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. For the very steep rotation law
\Omega\propto R^{-2} (the Rayleigh limit) and for small Pm the threshold values

laboratory experiment with liquid metals like sodium or gallium in a
Taylor-Couette container has been designed on the basis of this finding. For
fluids with more flat rotation laws the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number
are no longer typical quantities for the instability. For the weakly nonlinear
system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy are
derived for magnetic Prandtl numbers \leq 1. We find that the magnetic energy
grows monotonically with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, while the kinetic
energy grows with Rm/\sqrt{Pm}. The resulting turbulent Schmidt number, as the
ratio of the `eddy' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar

unity. Hence, in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the

the potential role of mass loss in metal poor dwarfs. Self-consistent stellar
evolutionary models that include all the effects of atomic diffusion and
radiative accelerations for 28 chemical species were computed for stellar
masses between 0.6 and 0.8 Msun. Models with an initial metallicity of
Z_0=0.00017 and mass loss rates from 10e-15 Msun to 10e-12 Msun were
calculated. They were then compared to previous models with mass loss, as well
as to models with turbulent mixing. For models with an initial metallicity of
Fe/H=-2.31, mass loss rates of about 10e-12 Msun lead to surface abundance
profiles that are very similar to those obtained in models with turbulence.
Both models have about the same level of agreement with observations of
galactic-halo lithium abundances, as well as lithium and other elemental
abundances from metal poor globular clusters such as NGC 6397. In this cluster,
models with mass loss agree slightly better with subgiant observations of Li
abundance than those with turbulence. Lower red giant branch stars instead
favor the models with turbulence. Larger differences between models with mass
loss and those with turbulence appear in the interior concentrations of metals.
The relatively high mass loss rates required to reproduce plateau-like lithium
abundances appear unlikely when compared to the solar mass-loss rate. However
the presence of a chromosphere on these stars justifies further investigation
of the mass-loss rates.

reveal that changes in the charge state of O2 dimers controls the defect
chemistry and conductivity of Li2O2. Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+)
and small hole polarons are identified as the dominant charge carriers. The
electronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 x 10-20 S/cm) is
comparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the migration of Li-ions (4 x
10-19 S/cm), suggesting that charge transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture
of ionic and polaronic contributions. These data indicate that the bulk regions
of crystalline Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge transport
occurring only at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial
delithiation. The implications of limited charge transport on discharge and
recharge mechanisms are discussed, and a two-stage charging process linking
charge transport, discharge product morphology, and overpotentials is
described. We conclude that achieving both high discharge capacities and
efficient charging will depend upon access to alternative mechanisms that
bypass bulk charge transport. More generally, we describe how the presence of a
species that can change charge state - e.g., O2 dimers in alkaline metal-based
peroxides - may impact rechargeability in metal-air batteries.

stars has been the subject of active investigation over the past three decades.
Although several solar twins have been found with stellar parameters similar to
those of the Sun (albeit in a range of Li abundances and with somewhat
different compositions), their rotation periods are unknown, except for 18 Sco,
which is younger than the Sun and with a rotation period shorter than solar. It
is difficult to obtain rotation periods for stars of solar age from
ground-based observations, as a low activity level imply a shallow rotational
modulation of their light curves. CoRoT has provided space-based long time
series from which the rotation periods of solar twins as old as the Sun could
be estimated. Based on high S/N high resolution spectroscopic observations
gathered at the Subaru Telescope, we show that the star CoRoT ID 102684698
(CoRoT Sol 1) is a somewhat evolved solar twin with a low Li abundance. Its
rotation period is 29 +- 5 days, compatible with its age (6.7 Gyr) and low
lithium content A(Li) < 0.85 dex. Interestingly, our CoRoT solar twin seems to
have enhanced abundances of the refractory elements with respect to the Sun, a
typical characteristic of most nearby twins. With a magnitude V ~14.1, ID
102684698 is the first solar twin revealed by CoRoT, the farthest field solar
twin so far known, and the only solar twin older than the Sun for which a
rotation period has been determined.

spallation, these stars at [Fe/H]<-2 are expected to show an undetectably small
6Li/7Li isotopic signature. Evidence to the contrary may necessitate an
additional pre-galactic production source or a revision of the standard model
of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We revisit the isotopic analysis of four halo
stars, two with claimed 6Li-detections in the literature, to investigate the
influence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. For the
first time, a combined 3D, NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) modelling
technique for Li, Na, and Ca lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsic
line-broadening and to determine the Li isotopic ratio. We discuss the
influence of 3D NLTE effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism of
our modelling using the Ca excitation and ionisation balance. By accounting for
NLTE line formation in realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we can
model the Li resonance line and other neutral lines with a consistency that is
superior to LTE, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by the
presence of 6Li. Contrary to the results from 1D and 3D LTE modelling, no star
in our sample has a significant 2-sigma detection of the lighter isotope in
NLTE. Over a large parameter space, NLTE modelling systematically reduces the
best-fit Li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. As a bi-product,
we also present the first ever 3D NLTE Ca and Na abundances of halo stars,
which reveal significant departures from LTE. The observational support for a

information processing. They give access to large Hilbert spaces and, in turn,
enable the encoding of quantum information on multiple modes. One method to
create such quantum states is parametric down-conversion (PDC) in waveguide
arrays (WGAs) which allows for the creation of highly entangled photon-pairs in
controlled, easily accessible spatial modes, with unique spectral properties.
In this paper we examine both theoretically and experimentally the PDC process
in a lithium niobate WGA. We measure the spatial and spectral properties of the
emitted photon-pairs, revealing strong correlations between spectral and
spatial degrees of freedom of the created photons. Our measurements show that,
in contrast to prior theoretical approaches, spectrally dependent coupling
effects have to be taken into account in the theory of PDC in WGAs. To
interpret the results, we developed a theoretical model specifically taking
into account spectrally dependent coupling effects, which further enables us to
explore the capabilities and limitations for engineering the spatial
correlations of the generated quantum states.

additive correction to standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
of form $\Delta U(D)=f(D)[U^{vdW}(D)-U^{DFT}(D)]$ where $D$ is the interlayer
distance. The functions are parametrised by matching contact properties, and
long-range dispersion to known values, and the model is found to accurately
match high-level \emph{ab initio} results for graphite across a wide range of
$D$ values. We employ the correction on the difficult bigraphene binding and
graphite exfoliation problems, as well as lithium intercalated graphite
LiC$_6$. We predict the binding energy of bigraphene to be 0.27 J/m^2, and the

slightly more than the bulk layer binding energy 0.295 J/m^2/layer. Material

spread implied by the luminosity dispersion seen in colour magnitude diagrams.
Evidence for weak lithium depletion (< 10 per cent in equivalent width) that is

the small amplitude of the rotational modulation. Using the empirical relations
between emission flux of chromospheric lines and X-ray flux, this star is
considered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the Sun. It
probably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energy
enough to give rise to superflares. We also estimated the stellar parameters,

rotational velocity (v sin_i), and radial velocity. KIC6934317 is then
confirmed to be an early G-type main sequence star. The value of v sin_i is
estimated to be ~1.91 km s^-1. In contrast, the rotational velocity is
calculated to be ~20 km s^-1 by using the period of the brightness variation as
the rotation period. This difference can be explained by its small inclination
angle (nearly pole-on). The small inclination angle is also supported by the
contrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellar
brightness variation amplitude. The lithium abundance and isochrones implies
that the age of this star is more than about a few Gyr, though a problem why
this star with such an age has a strong activity remains unsolved.

functional form as derived previously for three identical particles. We derive
analytic relations between the three different Faddeev components for three
distinguishable particles. We investigate the one-body momentum distributions
both analytically and numerically and analyze the tail of the distributions to
obtain two- and three-body contact parameters. We specialize from the general
cases to examples of two identical, interacting or non-interacting, particles.
We find that the two-body contact parameter is not a universal constant in the
general case and show that the universality is recovered when a subsystem is
composed of two identical non-interacting particles. We also show that the
three-body contact parameter is negligible in the case of one non-interacting
subsystem compared to the situation where all subsystem are bound. As example,
we present results for mixtures of Lithium with two Cesium or two Potassium
atoms, which are systems of current experimental interest.

  Stellar Objects: the case of two candidate old disks in the Orion Nebula
  Cluster","  Current planet formation models are largely based on the observational
constraint that protoplanetary disks have lifetime 3Myr. Recent studies,
however, report the existence of PMS stars with signatures of accretion
(strictly connected with the presence of circumstellar disks)and
photometrically determined ages of 30 Myr, or more. Here we present a
spectroscopic study of two major age outliers in the ONC. We use broad band,
intermediate resolution VLT/X-Shooter spectra combined with an accurate method
to determine the stellar parameters and the related age of the targets to
confirm their peculiar age estimates and the presence of ongoing accretion.The
analysis is based on a multi-component fitting technique, which derives
simultaneously SpT, extinction, and accretion properties of the objects. With
this method we confirm and quantify the ongoing accretion. From the
photospheric parameters of the stars we derive their position on the HRD, and
the age given by evolutionary models. Together with other age indicators like
the lithium equivalent width we estimate with high accuracy the age of the
objects. Our study shows that the two objects analyzed are not older than the
typical population of the ONC. Our results show that, while photometric
determination of the photospheric parameters are an accurate method to estimate
the parameters of the bulk of young stellar populations, those of individual
objects with high accretion rates and extinction may be affected by large
uncertainties. Broad band spectroscopic determinations should thus be used to
confirm the nature of individual objects. Our analysis shows that this method
allows us to obtain an accurate determination of the photospheric parameters of
accreting YSOs in any nearby star-forming region. We suggest that our detailed,
broad- band spectroscopy method should be used to derive accurate properties of
candidate old and accreting YSOs.

induced by the positronium decay represents either a potential signature for
anti-neutrino detection, via inverse beta decay, or to identify and suppress
positron background, as recently demonstrated by the Borexino experiment. The
formation probability and decay time of o-Ps depend strongly on the surrounding
material. In this paper, we characterize the o-Ps properties in liquid
scintillators as function of concentrations of gadolinium, lithium, neodymium,

particular, gadolinium and lithium are high neutron cross section isotopes,
widely used in reactor anti-neutrino experiments, while neodymium and tellurium

to tune the preparation of the scintillator in order to maximize the o-Ps

metasilicate $Li_2SiO_3$, a network forming ionic glass, by means of molecular
dynamics simulations. The system is characterized by a network of $SiO_4$
tetrahedra disrupted by $Li$ ions which diffuse through the network. Measures
of mean square displacement of $Si$ and $O$ atoms allow us to identify a
temperature at which tetrahedra stop moving relative to each other. This
temperature $T_c\approx 1500\,K$ can be characterized within the framework of
mode coupling theory. At a much lower temperature $T_g\approx 1000\,K$, a
change in the slope of the volume versus temperature data allows to single out
the glass transition. We find signatures of both transitions in structural
order parameters, related to the orientation of tetrahedra. Going down in
temperature we find that, around the mode coupling transition temperature, a
set of order parameters which measure the relative orientation of tetrahedra
cease to increase and stay constant below $T_c$. Another well known measure of
orientational order, the bond orientational order parameter, which in the
studied system measures local order within single tetrahedrons, is found to
continue growing below $T_c$ until $T_g$, below which it remains constant. Our
results allow to relate two characteristic dynamic transitions with
corresponding structural transitions, as observed in two different
orientational order parameters. Furthermore, the results indicate that the
network of thetrahedra continue to relax well below the point where neighboring
tetrahedra cannot rearrange relative to each other, and the glass is reached
only upon a process of relaxation of atoms which form the thetrahedron, as
quantified by the change in the bond orientational order parameters.

Typical three-wave nonlinear interactions among the involved OAM modes are

both of the azimuthal and radial indices of the OAM states keep constant in
most of the cases. However, abnormal change of the radial index is observed
when there is asynchronous nonlinear conversion in different parts of the
beams. The QPM nonlinear evolution of fractional OAM states is also discussed

diffusion to two-phase shrinking-core dynamics. This general approach extends
previous Li-ion battery models, which either neglect phase separation or
postulate a spherical shrinking-core phase boundary, by predicting phase

At the bulk-2D interface van der Waals attraction dominates the interfacial
binding rather than the dipole-diploe attraction. The absolute values of the

boundary (LDB) -- the luminosity at which Li remains unburned in a coeval
group. The LDB age of the BPMG is 21 +/- 4 Myr and insensitive to the choice of

accurate, and much older than that commonly assumed for the BPMG. As a result,
substellar and planetary companions of BPMG members will be more massive than

fields is investigated in a wavelength regime where the inner electron dynamics
is usually assumed to be negligible. The role of inner electrons is of
particular interest for the application of frozen-core approximations and
pseudopotentials in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the
single-active-electron (SAE) approximation in strong-field laser physics.
Results of TDDFT and SAE calculations are compared with exact ones obtained by
the numerical ab initio solution of the three-electron time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation for a lithium model atom. It is found that dynamical
anti-screening, i.e., a particular form of dynamical core polarization, may
substantially alter the ionization rate in the single-photon regime.
Requirements for the validity of the approximations in the single and
multiphoton ionization domain are identified.

consider examples of the lightest elements, H and He, for which the isotopic

quantification of the hydrogen isotope complex phenomena in liquid metals for
nuclear technology. Liquid metals under nuclear irradiation in,e.g., breeding
blankets of a nuclear fusion reactor would generate tritium which is to be
extracted and recirculated as fuel. At the same time that tritium is bred,
helium is also generated and may precipitate in the form of nano bubbles. Other
liquid metal systems of a nuclear reactor involve hydrogen isotope absorption
processes, e.g., tritium extraction system. Hence, hydrogen isotope absorption
into gas bubbles modelling and control may have a capital importance regarding
design, operation and safety.
  Here general models for hydrogen isotopes transport in liquid metal and
absorption into gas phase, that do not depend on the mass transfer limiting
regime, are exposed and implemented in OpenFOAMR CFD tool for 0D to 3D
simulations. Results for a 0D case show the impact of a He dispersed phase of
nano bubbles on hydrogen isotopes inventory at different temperatures as well
as the inventory evolution during a He nucleation event. In addition, 1D and 2D
axisymmetric cases are exposed showing the effect of a He dispersed gas phase
on hydrogen isotope permeation through a lithium lead eutectic alloy and the
effect of vortical structures on hydrogen isotope transport at a backward

technology regarding the importance of controlling hydrogen isotope transport

Galactic Halo stars contains crucial information on the formation mode of the
first generation of stars. To determine this observationally, it is necessary
to observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. We present here the
Turn-Off Primordial Stars survey (TOPoS) that is conducted as an ESO Large
Programme at the VLT. This project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand the
formation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weak
tail of the halo MDF below [M/H]=-3.5. In particular, we aim at determining the
critical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for the
formation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of the
elements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massive
first stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the time
when the Galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of C-enhanced extremely
metal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. The large
number of stars observed in the SDSS provides a good sample of candidates of
stars at extremely low metallicity. Candidates with turn-off colours down to
magnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of SDSS by means
of an automated procedure. X-Shooter has the potential of performing the
necessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities and
abundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. We here present the
stellar parameters of the first set of stars. The nineteen stars range in iron
abundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the Sun. Two stars have a high
radial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear to
be marginally bound to the Galaxy and are possibly accreted from another
galaxy.

about 0.1 dex lower than the lowest Li abundance observed among the un-depleted

suggest that stars that are more metal-rich than [FeH] \sim -1.0 experience
significant lithium depletion during their lifetime on the main sequence, while
the more metal-poor stars do not. Rather strikingly, our results suggest that
initial lithium abundance with which the star was created may only depend on
its age (the younger the star, the higher its Li content) and not on its

2.5 MK, and temperatures of just such magnitude are associated with the base of
the convection zone: magnetic inhibition of convective onset can shift this
base slightly closer to the surface, i.e. to slightly lower temperatures,
thereby reducing the amount of Li depletion compared to a non-magnetic model.
In the present paper, we consider how our magneto-convection models handle the
new test of stellar structure provided by Li measurements. Among the prime
systems listed by Torres, we find that plausible magnetic models work well for
CM Dra and YY Gem but not for CU Cnc. (The fourth system in Torres's list does
not yet have enough information to warrant magnetic modeling.) For CU Cnc, we
suggest that the observed lithium may have been accreted from a circumstellar
disk. We find that our magneto-convection models of CM Dra, YY Gem and CU Cnc
yield results which are consistent with the observed correlation between
magnetic flux and X-ray luminosity.

high-power electron gun at Soreq Nuclear Research Center. The lithium target,
to be bombarded by the high-intensity proton beam of the Soreq Applied Research
Accelerator Facility (SARAF), will constitute an intense source of neutrons
produced by the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction for nuclear astrophysics research and as a
pilot setup for accelerator-based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The
liquid-lithium jet target acts both as neutron-producing target and beam dump
by removing the beam thermal power (>5 kW, >1 MW/cm3) with fast transport. The
target was designed based on a thermal model, accompanied by a detailed
calculation of the 7Li(p,n) neutron yield, energy distribution and angular
distribution. Liquid lithium is circulated through the target loop at ~200oC
and generates a stable 1.5 mm-thick film flowing at a velocity up to 7 m/s onto
a concave supporting wall. Electron beam irradiation demonstrated that the
liquid-lithium target can dissipate electron power areal densities of > 4
kW/cm2 and volume power density of ~ 2 MW/cm3 at a lithium flow of ~4 m/s while
maintaining stable temperature and vacuum conditions. The LiLiT setup is
presently in online commissioning stage for high-intensity proton beam
irradiation (1.91- 2.5 MeV, 1-2 mA) at SARAF.

  with evidence of a circumbinary disk","  We present the discovery of CoRoT 223992193, a double-lined, detached
eclipsing binary, comprising two pre-main sequence M dwarfs, discovered by the
CoRoT space mission during a 23-day observation of the 3 Myr old NGC 2264
star-forming region. Using multi-epoch optical and near-IR follow-up
spectroscopy with FLAMES on the Very Large Telescope and ISIS on the William
Herschel Telescope we obtain a full orbital solution and derive the fundamental
parameters of both stars by modelling the light curve and radial velocity data.
The orbit is circular and has a period of $3.8745745 \pm 0.0000014$ days. The
masses and radii of the two stars are $0.67 \pm 0.01$ and $0.495 \pm 0.007$
$M_{\odot}$ and $1.30 \pm 0.04$ and $1.11 ~^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ $R_{\odot}$,
respectively. This system is a useful test of evolutionary models of young
low-mass stars, as it lies in a region of parameter space where observational
constraints are scarce; comparison with these models indicates an apparent age
of $\sim$3.5-6 Myr. The systemic velocity is within $1\sigma$ of the cluster
value which, along with the presence of lithium absorption, strongly indicates
cluster membership. The CoRoT light curve also contains large-amplitude,
rapidly evolving out-of-eclipse variations, which are difficult to explain
using starspots alone. The system's spectral energy distribution reveals a
mid-infrared excess, which we model as thermal emission from a small amount of
dust located in the inner cavity of a circumbinary disk. In turn, this opens up
the possibility that some of the out-of-eclipse variability could be due to
occultations of the central stars by material located at the inner edge or in
the central cavity of the circumbinary disk.

provide data on the neutron flux in the upper stratosphere at high latitudes at
thermal and nonthermal energies for the PoGOLite instrument. PoGOLite is a
balloon borne hard X-ray polarimeter for which the main source of background
stems from high energy neutrons. No measurements of the neutron environment for
the planned flight latitude and altitude exist. Furthermore this neutron
environment changes with altitude, latitude and solar activity, three variables
that will vary throughout the PoGOLite flight. PoGOLino was developed to study
the neutron environment and the influences from these three variables upon it.
PoGOLino consists of two Europium doped Lithium Calcium Aluminium Fluoride
(Eu:LiCAF) scintillators, each of which is sandwiched between 2 Bismuth
Germanium Oxide (BGO) scintillating crystals, which serve to veto signals
produced by gamma-rays and charged particles. This allows the neutron flux to
be measured even in high radiation environments. Measurements of neutrons in
two separate energy bands are achieved by placing one LiCAF detector inside a
moderating polyethylene shield while the second detector remains unshielded.
The PoGOLino instrument was launched on March 20th 2013 from the Esrange Space
Center in Northern Sweden to an altitude of 30.9 km. A description of the
detector design and read-out system is presented. A detailed set of simulations
of the atmospheric neutron environment performed using both PLANETOCOSMICS and

the consequences for the PoGOLite background will be discussed.

While the first-principles computations show that the Li capacity of pristine

present new determinations of lithium abundances for 326 Main Sequence stars
with and without planets in the T$_\mathrm{eff}$ range 5600-5900 K. 277 stars
come from the HARPS sample, the remaining targets have been observed with a
variety of high resolution spectrographs. We confirm significant differences in
the Li distribution of solar twins (T$_\mathrm{eff}$ = T$_{\odot} \pm$ 80 K,
log g = log g$_{\odot}$ $\pm$ 0.2 and [Fe/H] = [Fe/H]$_{\odot} \pm$ 0.2): the
full sample of planet host stars (22) shows Li average values lower than
""single"" stars with no detected planets (60). If we focus in subsamples with
narrower ranges in metallicity and age, we observe indications of a similar
result though it is not so clear for some of the studied subsamples.
Furthermore, we compare the observed spectra of several couples of stars with
very similar parameters which show different Li abundances up to 1.6 dex.
Therefore we show that neither age, nor mass nor metallicity of a parent star
is the only responsible for enhanced Li depletion in solar analogues. We
conclude that another variable must account for that difference and suggest
that this could be the presence of planets which causes additional rotationally
induced mixing in the external layers of planet host stars. Moreover, we find
indications that the amount of depletion of Li in planet host solar-type stars
is higher when the planets are more massive than Jupiter.

close reproduction of free electron dispersion. Experimentally, however, Li is
one of a handful of elemental solids (along with Cu, Ag, Au etc.) where the
sign of the Seebeck coefficient (S) is opposite to that of the carrier. This
counterintuitive behavior still lacks a satisfactory interpretation. We
calculate S fully from first-principles, within the framework of P.B. Allen's
formulation of Boltzmann transport theory. Here it is crucial to avoid the
constant relaxation time approximation, which gives a sign for S which is
necessarily that of the carriers. Our calculated S are in excellent agreement
with experimental data, up to the melting point. In comparison with another
alkali metal Na, we demonstrate that within the simplest non-trivial model for
the energy dependency of the electron lifetimes, the rapidly increasing density
of states (DOS) across the Fermi energy is related to the sign of S in Li. The
exceptional energy dependence of the DOS is beyond the free-electron model, as
the dispersion is distorted by the Brillouin Zone edge, a stronger effect in Li
than other Aliki metals. The electron lifetime dependency on energy is central,
but the details of the electron-phonon interaction are found to be less
important, contrary to what has been believed for several decades. Band
engineering combined with the mechanism exposed here may open the door to new

indicators. In this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars,
specifically those less than ~100 Myr old. Most age determination methods that
we discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used to
estimate the age of individual objects. A reliable age scale is established
above 20 Myr from measurement of the Lithium Depletion Boundary (LDB) in young
clusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the upper
main sequence and the main sequence turn-off -- if modest core convection and
rotation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. Other available
methods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placing
stars in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, pulsations and seismology, surface
gravity measurement, rotation and activity, and lithium abundance. We review
each of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. Below ~20
Myr, both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situation
is confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute ages

associated with free energy changes of Li+ transfer (Delta G_t) between the
solid and liquid phases. Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and
thermodynamic integration techniques, we compute Delta G_t for the virtual
transfer of a Li+ from a LiC(6) anode slab, with pristine basal planes exposed,

at Delta G_t=0, is found to occur on LiC(6) anodes with negatively charged
basal surfaces. These negative surface charges are evidently needed to retain
Li+ inside the electrode, and should affect passivation (""SEI"") film formation
processes. Fast electrolyte decomposition is observed at even larger electron
surface densities. By assigning the experimentally known voltage (0.1 V vs.
Li+/Li metal) to the predicted delithiation onset, an absolute potential scale
is obtained. This enables voltage calibrations in simulation cells used in AIMD
studies, and paves the way for future prediction of voltage dependences in

light curves, the first reported rotation periods for this benchmark
zero-age-main-sequence open cluster. The distribution of these stars spans from
late-A or early-F dwarfs to mid-K with periods ranging from less than a day to
~8 days. The rotation period distribution has a morphology similar to the
coeval Pleiades cluster, suggesting the universal nature of stellar rotation
distributions. Employing two different gyrochronology methods, we find an age
of 146+13-14 Myr for the cluster. Using the same techniques, we infer an age of
134+9-10 Myr for the Pleiades measured from existing literature rotation
periods. These rotation-derived ages agree with independently determined
cluster ages based on the lithium depletion boundary technique. Additionally,
we evaluate different gyrochronology models, and quantify levels of agreement
between the models and the Blanco 1/Pleiades rotation period distributions,
including incorporating the rotation distributions of clusters at ages up to
1.1 Gyr. We find the Skumanich-like spin-down rate sufficiently describes the
rotation evolution of stars hotter than the Sun; however, we find cooler stars
rotating faster than predicted by a Skumanich-law, suggesting a mass dependence
in the efficiency of stellar angular momentum loss rate. Finally, we compare
the Blanco 1 and Pleiades rotation period distributions to available non-linear
angular momentum evolution models. We find they require a significant mass
dependence on the initial rotation rate of solar-type stars to reproduce the
observed range of rotation periods at a given stellar mass, and are furthermore
unable to predict the observed over-density of stars along the upper-envelope
of the clusters' rotation distributions.

We combine the constraints from all age diagnostics to estimate a system age of
~30-200 Myr. The 1.2-4.7 micron spectral energy distribution of the components
point toward T_eff=3200 +/- 500 K and T_eff=3100 +/- 500 K for NLTT 33370 A and

abundances of helium and deuterium are compared to the predictions of BBN to
infer the universal ratio of baryons to photons (or, the present Universe
baryon mass density parameter Omega_B h^2), as well as to constrain the
effective number of neutrinos (N_eff) and the number of equivalent neutrinos
(Delta N_nu). These BBN results are compared to those derived independently
from the Planck CMB data. In the absence of a light WIMP (chi), N_eff = 3.05(1
+ Delta N_nu/3). In this case, there is excellent agreement between BBN and the
CMB, but the joint fit finds that Delta N_nu = 0.40 +/- 0.17, disfavoring
standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN: Delta N_nu = 0) at 2.4 sigma, as well
as a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at 3.5 sigma. In the presence of a light
WIMP, the relation between N_eff and Delta N_nu depends on the WIMP mass,
leading to degeneracies among N_eff, Delta N_nu, and m_chi. The complementary
and independent BBN and CMB data can break some of these degeneracies.
Depending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or
complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set a lower bound to m_chi in the
range from 0.5 to 5 MeV, and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the
range from 5 to 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analyses find a best fit value for
the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu = 0.65, nearly independent of
the nature of the WIMP. The best fit still disfavors the absence of dark
radiation (Delta N_nu = 0 at 95% confidence), while allowing for the presence
of a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1 at less than 1 sigma). For all cases
considered here, the lithium problem persists. These results, presented at the

anodes are largely determined by the strength of binding between lithium (Li)
and sp2 carbon (C), which can vary significantly with subtle changes in
substrate structure, chemistry, and morphology. Here, we use density functional
theory calculations to investigate the interactions of Li with a wide variety
of sp2 C substrates, including pristine, defective, and strained graphene;
planar C clusters; nanotubes; C edges; and multilayer stacks. In almost all
cases, we find a universal linear relation between the Li-C binding energy and
the work required to fill previously unoccupied electronic states within the
substrate. This suggests that Li capacity is predominantly determined by two
key factors -- namely, intrinsic quantum capacitance limitations and the
absolute placement of the Fermi level. This simple descriptor allows for
straightforward prediction of the Li-C binding energy and related battery
characteristics in candidate C materials based solely on the substrate
electronic structure. It further suggests specific guidelines for designing
more effective C-based anodes. The method should be broadly applicable to
charge-transfer adsorption on planar substrates, and provides a
phenomenological connection to established principles in supercapacitor and
catalyst design.

N-ethyl-N-methylimidazolium (emim) and lithium. The comparison of the
experimental results with the simulations shows an exceptional agreement over a
wide temperature range. Of particular interest is the high agreement achieved
at lower temperature, which is a result of the extended simulation length of,
at least, a factor of 5 compared with previous work. The results show as the
addition of TFSI favor the formation of lithium dimers (Li+ - TFSI- - Li+). A
closer analysis of such dimers shows that involved lithium ions move nearly as
fast as single lithium ions although they have a different coordination and
much slower TFSI exchange rates.

  We study signatures of youth, such as lithium {\sc i} 6708 \AA, H$\alpha$

the kinematic memberships through age constraints.
  We find that 21 ($84\%$) targets show spectroscopic signatures of youth in

implied. For two further objects, age-related constraints remain difficult to
determine from our analysis. In addition, we confirm two moving group kinematic

Universe, change the energy and entropy densities at BBN and at recombination.
BBN, in combination with the CMB, can remove some of the degeneracies among
light WIMPs and equivalent neutrinos, constraining the existence and properties
of each. Depending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion,
real or complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set lower bounds to m_chi
in the range 0.5 - 5 MeV (m_chi/m_e > 1 - 10), and they identify best fit
values for m_chi in the range 5 - 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analysis finds a
best fit value for the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu ~ 0.65,
nearly independent of the nature of the WIMP. In the absence of a light WIMP
(m_chi > 20 MeV), N_eff = 3.05(1 + Delta N_nu /3). In this case, there is
excellent agreement between BBN and the CMB, but the joint fit reveals Delta

SSMs accurately predict the Li abundances of solar analogs at the zero-age main
sequence (ZAMS) within theoretical uncertainties. We then measure the rate of
MS Li depletion by removing the [Fe/H]-dependent ZAMS Li pattern from three
well-studied clusters, and comparing the detrended data. MS depletion is found
to be mass dependent, in the sense of more depletion at low mass. A dispersion
in Li abundance at fixed $T_{\rm eff}$ is nearly universal, and sets in by
$\sim$200 Myr. We discuss mass and age dispersion trends, and the pattern is
mixed. We argue that metallicity impacts the ZAMS Li pattern, in agreement with
theoretical expectations but contrary to the findings of some previous studies,
and suggest Li as a test of cluster metallicity. Finally, we argue that a
radius dispersion in stars of fixed mass and age, during the epoch of pre-MS Li
destruction, is responsible for the spread in Li abundances and the correlation
between rotation and Li in young cool stars, most well known in the Pleiades.
We calculate stellar models, inflated to match observed radius anomalies in
magnetically active systems, and the resulting range of Li abundances
reproduces the observed patterns of young clusters. We discuss ramifications

population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. The spatial distribution of

a very narrow distribution (+/-5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity
distribution is very small, with a scatter of +/-1.1 km/s about the mean UVW
velocity. We also show that the isochronal age (20--30 Myr) and the lithium
depletion age (40 Myr) disagree, following a trend seen in other PMS
populations. The Halpha emission follows a trend of increasing EW with later
SpT, as seen for young clusters. We find that members have been depleted of
lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. Finally, our purely kinematic and
color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and
completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60% of

  Elemental Abundances and Effective Neutrino Number","  The primordial lithium abundance inferred from observations of metal-poor
stars is ~3 times smaller than the theoretical value in standard big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) model. We assume a simple model including a sterile
neutrino nu_H with mass of O(10) MeV which decays long after BBN. We then
investigate cosmological effects of a sterile neutrino decay. We formulate the
injection spectrum of nonthermal photons induced by electrons and positrons
generated at the nu_H decay, as a function of the nu_H mass and the photon
temperature. We then consistently solve (1) the cosmic thermal history, (2)
nonthermal nucleosynthesis induced by the nonthermal photons, (3) the
baryon-to-photon ratio eta, and (4) the effective neutrino number N_eff.
Amounts of energy injection at the nu_H decay are constrained from limits on
primordial D and 7Li abundances, the N_eff value, and the cosmic microwave
background energy spectrum. We find that 7Be is photodisintegrated and the Li
problem is partially solved for the lifetime 10^4-10^5 s and the mass >~ 14
MeV. 7Be destruction by more than a factor of 3 is not possible because of an
associated D over-destruction. In the parameter region, the eta value is
decreased slightly, while the N_eff value is increased by a factor of <~ 1. In
this study, errors in photodisintegration cross sections of 7Be(g, a)3He and
7Li(g, a)3H that have propagated through literatures are corrected. It is then
found that the new photodisintegration rates are 2.3 to 2.5 times smaller than
the old rates, so that efficiencies of 7Be and 7Li photodisintegration are
significantly smaller.

  group membership","  The K-type binary star HD 102077 was proposed as a candidate member of the TW
Hydrae Association (TWA) which is a young (5-15 Myr) moving group in close
proximity (~50 pc) to the solar system. The aim of this work is to verify this
hypothesis by different means. We first combine diffraction-limited
observations from the ESO NTT 3.5m telescope in SDSS-i' and -z' passbands and
ESO 3.6m telescope in H-band with literature data to obtain a new, amended
orbit fit, estimate the spectral types of both components, and reanalyse the
Hipparcos parallax and proper motion taking the orbital motion into account.
Moreover, we use two high-resolution spectra of HD 102077 obtained with the
fibre-fed optical echelle spectrograph FEROS at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope to
determine the radial velocity and the lithium equivalent width of the system.
  The trajectory of HD 102077 is well constrained and we derive a total system
mass of $2.6 \pm 0.8\,$ M$_{\odot}$ and a semi-major axis of $14.9 \pm
1.6\,$AU. From the i'-z' colours we infer an integrated spectral type of K2V,
and individual spectral types of K0 +/- 1 and K5 +/- 1. The radial velocity
corrected for the orbital motion of the system is $17.6 \pm 2\,$km/s. Even
though the parallax determination from the Hipparcos data is not influenced by
the orbital motion, the proper motion changes to $\mu_\alpha*\cos(\delta) =
-137.84 \pm 1.26\,$ mas/yr and $\mu_\delta = -33.53 \pm 1.45 \,$mas/yr. With
the resultant space motion, the probability of HD 102077 being a member of TWA
is less than 1%. Furthermore, the lithium equivalent width of $200 \pm 4\,$m\AA
$\,$ is consistent with an age between 30 Myr and 120 Myr and thus older than
the predicted age of TWA. In conclusion, HD 102077's age, galactic space
motion, and position do not fit TWA or any other young moving group.

represents a challenge for stellar evolution models. Stellar clusters are
privileged environments for this kind of investigation. Aims. To investigate
the chemical abundance pattern of the old open cluster Trumpler\,5, we observed
a sample of four red-clump stars with high-resolution optical spectrographs.
One of them (#3416) reveals extremely strong lithium lines in its spectrum.
Methods. One-dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was
performed on the spectra of the observed stars. A 3D-NLTE analysis was
performed to derive the lithium abundance of star #3416. Results. Star #3416 is
super Li-rich with A(Li)=3.75\,dex. The lack of $^6$Li enrichment
($^6$Li/$^7$Li$<$2%), the low carbon isotopic ratio
($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C=14$\pm$3), and the lack of evidence for radial velocity
variation or enhanced rotational velocity ($v\sin i = 2.8\,$\kms) all suggest
that lithium production has occurred in this star through the Cameron & Fowler
mechanism. Conclusions. We identified a super Li-rich core helium-burning,
red-clump star in an open cluster. Internal production is the most likely cause
of the observed enrichment. Given the expected short duration of a star's
Li-rich phase, enrichment is likely to have occurred at the red clump or in the
immediately preceding phases, namely during the He-flash at the tip of the red
giant branch (RGB) or while ascending the brightest portion of the RGB.

  Planck","  Primordial or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is one of the three historical
strong evidences for the big bang model. The recent results by the Planck
satellite mission have slightly changed the estimate of the baryonic density
compared to the previous WMAP analysis. This article updates the BBN
predictions for the light elements using the cosmological parameters determined
by Planck, as well as an improvement of the nuclear network and new
spectroscopic observations. There is a slight lowering of the primordial Li/H
abundance, however, this lithium value still remains typically 3 times larger
than its observed spectroscopic abundance in halo stars of the Galaxy.
According to the importance of this ""lithium problem"", we trace the small
changes in its BBN calculated abundance following updates of the baryonic
density, neutron lifetime and networks. In addition, for the first time, we
provide confidence limits for the production of 6Li, 9Be, 11B and CNO,
resulting from our extensive Monte Carlo calculation with our extended network.
A specific focus is cast on CNO primordial production. Considering
uncertainties on the nuclear rates around the CNO formation, we obtain CNO/H
\approx (5-30) x 10^{-15}. We further improve this estimate by analyzing
correlations between yields and reaction rates and identified new influential
reaction rates. These uncertain rates, if simultaneously varied could lead to a
significant increase of CNO production: CNO/H \sim 10^{-13}. This result is
important for the study of population III star formation during the dark ages.

Tel and member of the about 12 Myr old Beta Pic moving group was found by
high-contrast direct imaging independently by two teams. In order to determine
the basic parameters of this companion more precisely and independent of
evolutionary models, hence age independent, we obtained follow-up spectroscopic
observations of primary and companion. We use the Spectrograph for INtegral
Field Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) at the Very Large Telescope
Unit 4/YEPUN of ESO's Paranal Observatory in H+K band and process the data
using the spectral deconvolution technique. The resulting spectrum of the
companion is then compared to a grid of Drift-Phoenix synthetic model spectra,
a combination of a general-purpose model atmosphere code with a
non-equilibrium, stationary cloud and dust model, using a chi^2 minimization
analysis. We find a best fitting spectral type of G6.5 for PZ Tel A. The
extracted spectrum of the sub-stellar companion, at a spatial position
compatible with earlier orbit estimates, yields a temperature Teff= 2500
+138-115 K, a visual extinction A_V= 0.53 +0.84-0.53 mag, a surface gravity of
log g= 3.50 +0.51-0.30 dex, and a metallicity at the edge of the grid of [M/H]=
0.30 -0.30 dex. We derive a luminosity of log(Lbol/Lsun)= -2.66 +0.06-0.08, a
radius of R= 2.42 +0.28-0.34 R_Jup and a mass of M= 7.5 +16.9-4.3 M_Jup for the
PZ Tel companion, being consistent with most earlier estimates using photometry
alone. Combining our results with evolutionary models, we find a best fitting
mass of about 21 Jupiter masses at an age corresponding to the recently
determined lithium depletion age of 7 +4-2 Myr. Hence, the PZ Tel companion is
most likely a wide brown dwarf companion in the 12 +8-4 Myr old Beta Pic moving

the discovery of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters.
According to this model, the existence of well defined (anti)-correlations
amongst light element abundances (i.e. C, N, O, Na) in the photospheres of
stars belonging to the same cluster (and the associated helium enrichment), is
caused by accretion of the ejecta of short lived interacting massive binary
systems (and single fast rotating massive stars) on fully convective pre-main
sequence low- and very low-mass stars, during the early stages of the cluster
evolution. We investigated the constraints provided by considering
simultaneously the observed spread of lithium and oxygen (and when possible
also sodium) abundances for samples of turn-off stars in NGC6752, NGC6121 (M4),
and NGC104 (47Tuc), and the helium abundance of their multiple main sequences.
These observations provide a very powerful test for the accretion scenario,
because the observed O, Li and He abundance distributions at the turn off can
be used to constrain the composition (and mass) of the accreted matter, and the
timescales of the polluting stars. In case of NGC6752 we could not find a
physically consistent solution. In case of M4, spectroscopic errors are too
large compared to the intrinsic spread, to constrain the properties of the
accreted matter. As for 47Tuc, we could find a physically consistent solution
for the abundances of He and O (and Na) in the accreted gas, and predict the
abundances of these elements in the accreted matter only if pollution happens
with timescales of ~1 Myr, hence polluters are objects with masses of the order
of several tens of solar masses (abridged).

evident when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size
determined solely by Planck's constant h. The observations of quantized steps
in the electric conductance have provided important insights into the physics
of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic
devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of
electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In
its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi
gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with
dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the
observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We
employ high resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize
either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions
are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two
adjustable reservoirs of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning
either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we
observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The conductance in the
first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum.
For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data
and the Landauer formula, with all parameters determined a priori. Our
experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic device and can be
readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases.

physical quantities and/or matrix elements defined on the Fermi surface of
metallic materials. The method introduces a set of numerically calculated
generalized orthonormal functions which are the solutions of the Helmholtz
equation defined on the Fermi surface. Noteworthy, many properties of our
proposed basis set are also shared by the Fermi Surface Harmonics (FSH)
introduced by Philip B. Allen [Physical Review B 13, 1416 (1976)], proposed to
be constructed as polynomials of the cartesian components of the electronic
velocity. The main motivation of both approaches is identical, to handle
anisotropic problems efficiently. However, in our approach the basis set is
defined as the eigenfunctions of a differential operator and several desirable
properties are introduced by construction. The method demonstrates very robust
in handling problems with any crystal structure or topology of the Fermi
surface, and the periodicity of the reciprocal space is treated as a boundary
condition for our Helmholtz equation. We illustrate the method by analysing the
free-electron-like Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Copper (Cu), Lead(Pb), Tungsten
(W) and Magnesium diboride (MgB2).

obtained with the VLT/Giraffe HR15n setup, using observations from the Gaia-ESO
Survey, on the gamma Vel young cluster, in order to determine the fundamental
parameters of these stars. We define a set of spectroscopic indices, sampling
TiO bands, H-alpha core and wings, and many temperature- and gravity-sensitive
lines. Combined indices tau (gamma) are also defined as Teff (log g) indicators
over a wide spectral-type range. H-alpha emission-line indices are also
chromospheric activity or accretion indicators. A metallicity-sensitive index
is also defined. These indices enable us to find a clear difference between
gravities of main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars (as well as giant
stars): the (gamma,tau) diagram is thus argued to be a promising
distance-independent age measurement tool for young clusters.
  Our indices were quantitatively calibrated by means of photometry and
literature reference spectra (from UVES-POP and ELODIE 3.1 Libraries, and other
datasets), over a wide range of stellar parameters. The ability of our indices
to select peculiar, or other rare classes of stars is also established.
Finally, our gravity determinations support the existence of an older
pre-main-sequence population in the gamma Vel sky region, in agreement with the
lithium depletion pattern of those stars (abridged).

can reduce the predicted freeze-out amount of $^7$Be + $^7$Li that otherwise
remains in sharp contradiction with the Spite plateau value inferred from the

D/H determinations puts a strong constraint on any such scenario. We address
this issue in detail, analyzing different temporal patterns of neutron
injection, such as decay, annihilation, resonant annihilation, and oscillation
between mirror and standard model world neutrons. For this latter case, we
derive the realistic injection pattern taking into account thermal effects
(damping and refraction) in the primordial plasma. If the extra neutron supply
is the sole non-standard mechanism operating during the BBN, the suppression of
lithium abundance below Li/H~$\leq 1.9 \times 10^{-10}$ always leads to the
overproduction of deuterium, D/H~$\geq 3.6 \times 10^{-5}$, well outside the

shock problem and the recent lithium ion battery, the maximum diffusion induced
stress (DIS) is a very important quantity. However a widely accepted, accurate
and easy-to-use quantitative formula on it still lacks. In this paper, by
normalizing the governing equations, an almost analytical model is developed,
except a single-variable function of the dimensionless Biot number which cannot
be determined analytically and is then given by a curve. Formulae for various
typical geometries and working conditions are presented. If the stress and the
diffusion process are fully coupled (i.e. stress-dependent diffusion), as in
lithium ion diffusion, the normalized maximum DIS can be characterized by a
two-variable function of a dimensionless coupling parameter and the Biot
number, which is obtained numerically and presented in contour plots. Moreover,
it is interesting to note that these two parameters, within a wide range, can
be further approximately combined into a single dimensionless parameter to
characterize the maximum DIS. These formulae together with curves/contours
provide engineers and materialists a simple and easy way to quickly obtain the
stress and verify the reliability of materials under various typical diffusion
conditions. Via energy balance analysis, the model of diffusion induced
fracture is also developed. It interestingly predicts that the spacing of
diffusion induced cracks is constant, independent of the thickness of specimen
and the concentration difference. Our thermal shock experiments on alumina
plates validate these qualitative and quantitative theoretical predictions,
such as the constant crack spacing and the predicted critical temperature
difference at which the cracks initiate. Furthermore, the proposed model can
interpret the observed hierarchical crack patterns.

contribute to the completion of the stellar and substellar census of the solar
neighbourhood. We identified a new late-M dwarf within 5 pc, looking for high
proper motion sources in the 2MASS-WISE cross-match. We collected astrometric
and photometric data available from public large-scale surveys. We complemented
this information with low-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy
with instrumentation on the ESO NTT to confirm the nature of our candidate. We
also present a high-quality medium-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectrum covering
the 400 to 2500 nm wavelength range. We classify this new neighbour as an
M7.0$\pm$0.5 dwarf using spectral templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and spectral indices. Lithium absorption at 670.8 nm is not detected in the
X-shooter spectrum, indicating that the M7 dwarf is older than 600 Myr and more
massive than 0.06 M$_{\odot}$. We also derive a trigonometric distance of 4.4
pc, in agreement with the spectroscopic distance estimate, making
2MASS\,J154043.42$-$510135.7 the nearest M7 dwarf to the Sun. This
trigonometric distance is somewhat closer than the $\sim$6 pc distance reported
by the ALLWISE team, who independently identified this object recently. This
discovery represents an increase of 25\% in the number of M7--M8 dwarfs already
known at distances closer than 8\,pc from our Sun. We derive a density of
$\rho$\,=\,1.9$\pm$0.9$\times$10$^{-3}$\,pc$^{-3}$ for M7 dwarfs in the 8 pc
volume, a value similar to those quoted in the literature. This new ultracool
dwarf is among the 50 nearest systems to the Sun, demonstrating that our
current knowledge of the stellar census within the 5 pc sample remains
incomplete. 2M1540 represents a unique opportunity to search for extrasolar
planets around ultracool dwarfs due to its proximity and brightness.

Based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundances
for 17 elements in the range from Li to Ba. Three of the four stars exhibit
moderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in their
neutron-capture elements. The most metal-poor star in the sample,
HE~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbon
enhancement of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancement
plateau suggested by Spite et al. No carbon is detected in the spectrum of the
fourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determination
of an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} < +1.7$. We
detect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, including
HE~0233$-$0343. Both stars with Li detections are Li-depleted, with respect to
the Li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by Spite \& Spite. This suggests
that whatever site(s) produced C either do not completely destroy lithium, or
that Li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordial
Li in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. The derived abundances
for the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similar
to those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poor
stars. Finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of Sr and Ba for
these stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in the
early universe.

abundance trends with evolutionary phase for Ca, Ti, and Fe which are best
explained by stellar-structure models including atomic diffusion with efficient
additional mixing. We derive a new value for the initial lithium abundance of

mixing which falls slightly below the predicted standard BBN value. We find
three stellar populations by combining photometric and spectroscopic data of
194 stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. Abundance trends for groups of
elements, differently affected by atomic diffusion and additional mixing, are

  pre-main-sequence cluster Gamma Velorum","  Knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and young
clusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered star
formation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the ability
to form planetary systems.In spite of this, detailed abundance studies are
currently available for relatively few regions. In this context, we present the
analysis of the metallicity of the Gamma Velorum cluster, based on the products
distributed in the first internal release of the Gaia-ESO Survey. The Gamma
Velorum candidate members have been observed with FLAMES, using both UVES and
Giraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. In order to
derive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of the
observed stars must be first assessed. To this aim, we use several membership
criteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and the
detection of the photospheric lithium line. Out of the 80 targets observed with
UVES, we identify 14 high-probability members. We find that the metallicity of
the cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [Fe/H]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.
Although J08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, its
metallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. We speculate
about its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of
~60 M_Sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

  of a cylindrical electrode particle in a Li-ion battery","  A general framework to study the mechanical behaviour of a cylindrical
silicon anode particle in a lithium ion battery as it undergoes lithiation is
presented. The two-way coupling between stress and concentration of lithium in
silicon, including the possibility of plastic deformation, is taken into
account and two particular cases are considered. First, the cylindrical
particle is assumed to be free of surface traction and second, the axial
deformation of the cylinder is prevented. In both cases plastic stretches
develop through the entire cylinder and not just near the surface as is
commonly found in spherical anode particles. It is shown that the stress
evolution depends both on the lithiation rate and the external constraints.
Furthermore, as the cylinder expands during lithiation it can develop a
compressive axial stress large enough to induce buckling, which in turn may
lead to mechanical failure. An explicit criterion for swelling-induced buckling
obtained as a modification of the classical Euler buckling criterion shows the
competition between the stabilising effect of radius increase and the
destabilising effect of axial stress.

spectral range, for the extremely metal-poor star BD+44 493, a 9th magnitude
sub-giant with [Fe/H] = -3.8 and enhanced carbon, based on data acquired with
the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. This
star is the brightest example of a class of objects that, unlike the great
majority of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, does not exhibit
over-abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements (CEMP-no). In this paper, we
validate the abundance determinations for a number of species that were
previously studied in the optical region, and obtain strong upper limits for
beryllium and boron, as well as for neutron-capture elements from zirconium to
platinum, many of which are not accessible from ground-based spectra. The boron
upper limit we obtain for BD+44 493, logeps(B) < -0.70, the first such
measurement for a CEMP star, is the lowest yet found for very and extremely
metal-poor stars. In addition, we obtain even lower upper limits on the
abundances of beryllium, logeps(Be) < -2.3, and lead, logeps(Pb) < -0.23
([Pb/Fe] < +1.90), than those reported by previous analyses in the optical
range. Taken together with the previously measured low abundance of lithium,
the very low upper limits on Be and B suggest that BD+44 493 was formed at a
very early time, and that it could well be a bona-fide second-generation star.
Finally, the Pb upper limit strengthens the argument for non-s-process
production of the heavy-element abundance patterns in CEMP-no stars.

low-gravity atmospheres. We obtained J and Ks imaging data using 2-4-m class
telescopes with a typical cadence of one image per month between 2010 January
and 2012 December. We also obtained low resolution optical spectra (R~300,

proper motions were derived to typical accuracies of 1 mas and +/-10 mas/yr.
All ten L dwarfs have large motions, and are located at distances between 9 and

K_s magnitude versus spectral type and luminosity versus Teff diagrams,
implying ages similar to or smaller than those typical of the field. The
detection of atomic lithium in the atmosphere of 2MASS J00452143+1634446 is
reported for the first time. Three dwarfs have locations in the HR diagram

depletion previously published. We did not find evidence for the presence of
astrometric companions with minimum detectable masses typically >=25 Mjup and
face-on, circular orbits with periods between 60-90 d and 3 yr around eight

angular dispersion is shown to be the strongest limitation to THz generation in
lithium niobate for pumping at 1 micron. It is seen that the exclusion of these

exoplanet host (EH) stars and their planets. While techniques for detecting
exoplanets yield properties of the planet only as a function of the properties
of the host star, hence, we must accurately determine parameters of EH stars at
first. For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including
diffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input
parameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to
the commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature
T_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational
constraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period
P_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains
on the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar
properties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars
and their planets are with higher precision than previous works. Therefore, the
combination of rotational period and lithium help us to obtain more accurate
parameters for stars, leading to an improvement of the knowledge of the
physical state about the EH stars and their planets.

abundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li
problem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet
formation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of
Li, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of
stars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of
terrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired
high-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several
solar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among
the solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a
differential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.
[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =
4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03
km/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is
chemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly
more depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form
terrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,
and is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a
Li abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun
(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.
[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when
compared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host
rocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age
and fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different
ages.

However, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous

allowing us to further investigate this issue.
  Aims. We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I
star-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internal
release of the Gaia-ESO Survey.
  Methods. 48 candidate members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the
high-resolution spectrograph UVES. We use the surface gravity, lithium line
equivalent width and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to confirm the
cluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of
the region.
  Results. Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members.
Considering the metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the iron
abundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly subsolar with a mean value
[Fe/H]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. This result is in agreement with the metallicity
determination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the
chemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more
metal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this evidence may be related to the
chemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby
star-forming regions and young clusters.

trigger a solution-based growth mechanism due to their solvating properties,
thereby circumventing the Li$_2$O$_2$ conductivity limitation. Experimental

sets. In the H-R diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by the
models are accurate to better than 10% above 1 Msun, but below 1 Msun they are
discrepant by 50-100%. We find evidence that the failure of the models to match
the data is linked to the triples in the EB sample; at least half of the EBs
possess tertiary companions. Excluding the triples, the models reproduce the
stellar masses to better than ~10% in the H-R diagram, down to 0.5 Msun, below
which the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. We consider
several mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the EB properties
and thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. We show that the
energies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentially
explain the scatter in the EB properties through injection of heat, perhaps
involving tidal interaction. It seems from the evidence at hand that this
mechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surface
properties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithium
abundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. The EBs that
are members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, but
collectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreads
in young clusters. However, this apparent spread in the EB ages may also be the
result of scatter in the EB properties induced by tertiaries. [Abridged]

thermo-mechanical conditions. Within one breeder unit, the ceramic breeder bed
is composed of spherical-shaped lithium orthosilicate pebbles, and as a type of
granular material, it exhibits strong coupling between temperature and stress
fields. In this paper, we study these thermo-mechanical problems by developing
a thermal discrete element method (Thermal-DEM). This proposed simulation tool
models each individual ceramic pebble as one element and considers grain-scale
thermo-mechanical interactions between elements. A small section of solid
breeder pebble bed in HCPB is modelled using thousands of individual pebbles
and subjected to volumetric heating profiles calculated from neutronics under
ITER-relevant conditions. We consider heat transfer at the grain-scale between
pebbles through both solid-to-solid contacts and the interstitial gas phase,
and we calculate stresses arising from thermal expansion of pebbles. The
overall effective conductivity of the bed depends on the resulting compressive
stress state during the neutronic heating. The thermal-DEM method proposed in
this study provides the access to the grain-scale information, which is
beneficial for HCPB design and breeder material optimization, and a better
understanding of overall thermo-mechanical responses of the breeder units under
fusion-relevant conditions.

stellar populations. It appears that they experience at least two episodes of
star formation whereby a fraction of first-generation stars contribute astrated
ejecta to form the second generation(s). To identify the polluting progenitors
we require distinguishing chemical signatures such as that provided by lithium.
Theoretical models predict that lithium can be synthesised in AGB stars,
whereas no net Li production is expected from other candidates. It has been
shown that in order to reproduce the abundance pattern found in M4, Li
production must occur within the polluters, favouring the AGB scenario. Here we
present Li and Al abundances for a large sample of RGB stars in M12 and M5.
These clusters have a very similar metallicity, whilst demonstrating
differences in several cluster properties. Our results indicate that the
first-generation and second-generation stars share the same Li content in M12;
we recover an abundance pattern similar to that observed in M4. In M5 we find a
higher degree of complexity and a simple dilution model fails in reproducing
the majority of the stellar population. In both clusters we require Li
production across the different stellar generations, but production seems to
have occurred to different extents. We suggest that such a difference might be
related to the cluster mass with the Li production being more efficient in
less-massive clusters. This is the first time a statistically significant
correlation between the Li spread within a GC and its luminosity has been
demonstrated. Finally, although Li-producing polluters are required to account
for the observed pattern, other mechanisms, such as MS depletion, might have
played a role in contributing to the Li internal variation, though at
relatively low level.

59 candidate members of nearby young kinematic groups. The candidates were
identified through the BANYAN Bayesian inference method of \citet{2013malo},

The derived parameters are compared to Dartmouth Magnetic evolutionary models

find that, in general, low-mass stars in our sample are more luminous and have
inflated radii compared to older stars, a trend expected for pre-main sequence
stars. The Dartmouth Magnetic evolutionary models show a good fit to
observations of field K and M stars assuming a magnetic field strength of a few
kG, as typically observed for cool stars. Using the low-mass members of
$\beta$Pictoris moving group, we have re-examined the age inconsistency problem
between Lithium Depletion age and isochronal age (Hertzspring-Russell diagram).
We find that the inclusion of the magnetic field in evolutionary models
increase the isochronal age estimates for the K5V-M5V stars. Using these models
and field strengths, we derive an average isochronal age between 15 and 28 Myr

26$\pm$3~Myr is derived, consistent with previous age estimates based on this
method.

showing discrete abundances of helium in the core, that seem to be present in

accreting different masses. In addition, the same thermohaline mixing which
could provide a homogeneous helium distribution down to the stellar center,
would destroy any lithium surviving in the envelope, so that both helium
homogeneity and lithium survival require that the accretion phase be limited to
the first couple of million years of the cluster evolution. Such a short

three-dimensional in nature, and completely collapse in the two-dimensional
limit defined by their critical thicknesses. Meanwhile the ionic gating induces
multiple phase transitions from Mott-insulator to metal in 1T-TaS$_2$ thin
flakes at low temperatures, with 5 orders of magnitude modulation in their

i) relaxed tolerance on the pointing and cophasing, ii) higher accuracy in

single-mode optics like Lithium Niobate. The latter point being a huge asset in
the context of a space mission. One of the problems of DARWIN or SIM-like

that Lithium Niobate optic is small and compact makes it easy to test through

the FIRST-S demonstrator is to spatialize a 3U CubeSat with a Lithium Niobate

tracking, beam combination, and nulling capabilities. The optical baseline of
the interferometer would be 30 cm, giving a 2.2 AU spatial resolution at

molecular simulations. The rapid increase in computational power has made it
possible to probe increasingly complex systems, yet extracting accurate free
energies from these simulations remains a major challenge. Fully exploring the
free energy landscape of, say, a biological macromolecule typically requires
sampling large conformational changes and slow transitions. Often, the only
feasible way to study such a system is to simulate it using an enhanced
sampling method. The accelerated weight histogram (AWH) method is a new,
efficient extended ensemble sampling technique which adaptively biases the
simulation to promote exploration of the free energy landscape. The AWH method
uses a probability weight histogram which allows for efficient free energy
updates and results in an easy discretization procedure. A major advantage of
the method is its general formulation, making it a powerful platform for
developing further extensions and analyzing its relation to already existing
methods. Here, we demonstrate its efficiency and general applicability by
calculating the potential of mean force along a reaction coordinate for both a
single dimension and multiple dimensions. We make use of a non-uniform, free
energy dependent target distribution in reaction coordinate space so that
computational efforts are not wasted on physically irrelevant regions. We
present numerical results for molecular dynamics simulations of lithium acetate

results show that first-generation stars are less centrally concentrated and
dynamically hotter than stars belonging to subsequent generations. We also find

correlation found. To start investigating this claim, we have studied the
subgiant star HD 185351, which has precisely measured physical properties based
on asteroseismology and interferometry. An independent spectroscopic
differential analysis based on excitation and ionization balance of iron lines
yielded the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$ = 5035 $\pm$ 29 K, $\log$ g =

spot location. A single OBD spot location provides a limited picture of the
total cantilever motion and in fact, experimentally observed cantilever
amplitude and phase are shown to be strongly dependent on the OBD spot position
for many measurements. In this work, the commonly observed frequency dependence
of PFM response is explained through experimental measurements and analytic
theoretical EB modeling of the PFM response as a function of both frequency and
OBD spot location on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) sample. One
notable conclusion is that a common choice of OBD spot location, at or near the
tip of the cantilever is particularly vulnerable to frequency dependent
amplitude and phase variations stemming from dynamics of the cantilever sensor
rather than from the piezoresponse of the sample.

  statistical analysis","  Aims. We study the impact of the presence of planets on the lithium abundance
of host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium
depletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.
  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the
confounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying
a multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an
assumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends
linearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to
distinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of
an offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this
analysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and
include in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.
  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of
linearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance
between planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation
on the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required
to render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\sigma}
and make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by
our method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples. We
did so by showing that the offset is reduced down to zero if the planet-host
stars are replaced by comparison stars. Moreover, the measured depletion is
still significant when one imposes different constraints on the dataset, such
as a limit in planetary mass or constrain the host temperature to around solar
value. We conclude then that planet-host stars exhibit enhanced lithium
depletion when compared with non-host stars. (abridged)

observations of 23 low-mass stars in the L1615/L1616 cometary cloud,
complemented with FORS2 and VIMOS spectroscopy of 31 additional stars in the

triggered by the impact of the massive stars in the Orion OB association. From
the measurements of the lithium abundance and radial velocity, we confirm the
membership of our sample to the cloud. We use the equivalent widths of the
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and the HeI $\lambda$5876, $\lambda$6678, $\lambda$7065
\AA$ $emission lines to calculate the accretion luminosities, $L_{\rm acc}$,
and the mass accretion rates, $\dot M_{\rm acc}$. We find in L1615/L1616 a
fraction of accreting objects ($\sim 30\%$), which is consistent with the
typical fraction of accretors in T associations of similar age ($\sim 3$ Myr).
The mass accretion rate for these stars shows a trend with the mass of the
central object similar to that found for other star-forming regions, with a
spread at a given mass which depends on the evolutionary model used to derive
the stellar mass. Moreover, the behavior of the $2MASS/WISE$ colors with $\dot
M_{\rm acc}$ indicates that strong accretors with $\log \dot M_{\rm acc} \gt
-8.5$ dex show large excesses in the $JHK{\rm s}$ bands, as in previous
studies. We also conclude that the accretion properties of the L1615/L1616
members are similar to those of young stellar objects in T associations, like
Lupus.

MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and
an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide
(REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable
disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating
first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many
vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma
fusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap
fraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large
external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is
enabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO
superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative
inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron
fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust,
steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid
blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium
(FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides
effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a
tritium breeding ratio >= 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is
liquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a
high-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when
operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.

to derive LDB ages do not include the effects of magnetic activity on stellar
properties. In light of this, we present results from our spectroscopic study
of the very low-mass members of the southern open cluster Blanco 1 using the
Gemini-North telescope, program IDs: GN-2009B-Q-53 and GN-2010B-Q-96. We
obtained GMOS spectra at intermediate resolution for cluster candidate members

cluster members by considering proximity to the cluster sequence in an
$I/I-K\rm_s$ color-magnitude diagram, agreement with the cluster's systemic
radial velocity, and magnetic activity as a youth indicator. We systematically
analyze the H$\alpha$ and Li features and update the LDB age of Blanco 1 to be
$126^{+13}_{-14}$ Myr. Our new LDB age for Blanco 1 shows remarkable coevality
with the benchmark Pleiades open cluster. Using available empirical activity
corrections, we investigate the effects of magnetic activity on the LDB age of
Blanco 1. Accounting for activity, we infer a corrected LDB age of
$114^{+9}_{-10}$ Myr. This work demonstrates the importance of accounting for
magnetic activity on LDB inferred stellar ages, suggesting the need to
re-investigate previous LDB age determinations.

  the lithium depletion boundary","  In a coeval group of low-mass stars, the luminosity of the sharp transition
between stars that retain their initial lithium and those at slightly higher
masses in which Li has been depleted by nuclear reactions, the lithium
depletion boundary (LDB), has been advanced as an almost model-independent
means of establishing an age scale for young stars. Here we construct
polytropic models of contracting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) that have cool,
magnetic starspots blocking a fraction $\beta$ of their photospheric flux.
Starspots slow the descent along Hayashi tracks, leading to lower core
temperatures and less Li destruction at a given mass and age. The age,
$\tau_{\rm LDB}$, determined from the luminosity of the LDB, $L_{\rm LDB}$, is
increased by a factor $(1-\beta)^{-E}$ compared to that inferred from unspotted
models, where $E \simeq 1 + d\log \tau_{\rm LDB}/d \log L_{\rm LDB}$ and has a
value $\sim 0.5$ at ages $< 80$ Myr, decreasing to $\sim 0.3$ for older stars.
Spotted stars have virtually the same relationship between K-band bolometric
correction and colour as unspotted stars, so this relationship applies equally
to ages inferred from the absolute K magnitude of the LDB. Low-mass PMS stars
do have starspots, but the appropriate value of $\beta$ is highly uncertain
with a probable range of $0.1 < \beta < 0.4$. For the smaller $\beta$ values
our result suggests a modest systematic increase in LDB ages that is comparable
with the maximum levels of theoretical uncertainty previously claimed for the
technique. The largest $\beta$ values would however increase LDB ages by 20-30
per cent and demand a re-evaluation of other age estimation techniques
calibrated using LDB ages.

timescape cosmology is extremely close to the standard cosmology at early
epochs to adapt existing numerical codes to produce CMB anisotropy spectra, and
to match these as closely as possible to the timescape expansion history. A
variety of matching methods are studied and compared. We perform Markov Chain
Monte Carlo analyses on the parameter space, and fit CMB multipoles $50 \le
\ell \le 2500$ to the Planck satellite data. Parameter fits include a dressed
Hubble constant, $H_0 = 61.0$ km/s/Mpc ($\pm$ 1.3% stat) ($\pm$ 8% sys), and a

Lambda CDM cosmology in the same multipole range. In contrast to earlier
results, the parameter constraints afforded by this analysis no longer admit
the possibility of a solution to the primordial lithium abundance anomaly. This
issue is related to a strong constraint between the ratio of baryonic to
nonbaryonic dark matter and the ratio of heights of the second and third
acoustic peaks, which cannot be changed as long as the standard cosmology is
assumed up to the surface of last scattering. These conclusions may change if
backreaction terms are also included in the radiation-dominated primordial

to their slowly rotating counterparts. Motivated by observations of inflated
radii in young, active stars, and by calculations showing that radius inflation
inhibits pre-main sequence (pre-MS) Li destruction, we test whether this
pattern could arise from a connection between stellar rotation rate and radius
inflation on the pre-MS. We demonstrate that pre-MS radius inflation can
efficiently suppress lithium destruction by rotationally induced mixing in
evolutionary models, and that the net effect of inflation and rotational mixing
is a pattern where rotation correlates with lithium abundance for $M_{*} < {\rm
M}_{\odot}$, and anti-correlates with lithium abundance for $M_{*} > {\rm
M}_{\odot}$, similar to the empirical trend in the Pleiades. Next, we adopt
different prescriptions for the dependence of inflation on rotation, and
compare their predictions to the Pleiades lithium/rotation pattern. We find
that if a connection between rotation and radius inflation exists, then the
important qualitative features of this pattern naturally and generically emerge
in our models. This is the first consistent physical model to date that
explains the Li--rotation correlation in the Pleiades. We discuss plausible
mechanisms for inducing this correlation and suggest an observational test
using granulation.

long life. However, costs are prohibitive. Instead, we consider 'used' Li-ion
batteries for this application, finding experimentally that many discarded
laptop cells, for example, still have good capacity and cycle life. In order to
make safe and optimal use of such cells, we present a modular power management
system using a separate power converter for every cell. This novel approach
allows individual batteries to be used to their full capacity. The power
converters operate in voltage droop control mode to provide easy charge
balancing and implement a battery management system to estimate the capacity of
each cell, as we demonstrate experimentally.

acidity and to the corrosiveness of vehicle engines when it is used as fuel. In
order to verify the comparability and reliability of the measurement of pH in
bioethanol matrix among some experienced chemical laboratories, reference
material (RM) of bioethanol developed by Inmetro - the Brazilian National
Metrology Institute - was used in a proficiency testing (PT) scheme. There was
a difference of more than one unit in the value of the pH measured due to the
type of internal filling electrolytic solutions (potassium chloride, KCl or
lithium chloride, LiCl) from the commercial pH combination electrodes used by
the participant laboratories. Therefore, bimodal distribution has occurred from
the data of this PT scheme. This work aims to present the possibilities that a
PT scheme provider can use to overcome the bimodality problem. Data from the PT
of pH in bioethanol were treated by two different statistical approaches:
kernel density model and the mixture of distributions. Application of these
statistical treatments improved the initial diagnoses of PT provider, by
solving bimodality problem and contributing for a better performance evaluation
in measuring pH of bioethanol.

  Giants","  In recent years much interest has been shown in the process of thermohaline
mixing in red giants. In low and intermediate mass stars this mechanism first
activates at the position of the bump in the luminosity function, and has been
identified as a likely candidate for driving the slow mixing inferred to occur
in these stars. One particularly important consequence of this process, which
is driven by a molecular weight inversion, is the destruction of lithium. We
show that the degree of lithium destruction, or in some cases production, is
extremely sensitive to the numerical details of the stellar models. Within the
standard 1D diffusion approximation to thermohaline mixing, we find that
dfferent evolution codes, with their default numerical schemes, can produce
lithium abundances that differ from one another by many orders of magnitude.
This disagreement is worse for faster mixing. We perform experiments with four
independent stellar evolution codes, and derive conditions for the spatial and
temporal resolution required for a converged numerical solution. The results
are extremely sensitive to the timesteps used. We find that predicted lithium
abundances published in the literature until now should be treated with
caution.

associated nucleosynthesis, prematurely compared to in a single star. In wide

today observing its initially lower-mass companion. The star we see now may be
polluted by ejecta from the primary either through a wind or Roche-lobe

Galactic A-, F- and G-type supergiants and bright giants (luminosity classes I
and II), we undertook a non-LTE analysis of the carbon abundance in their
atmospheres. It is shown that the non-LTE corrections to the C abundances
derived from C I lines are negative and increase with the effective temperature
Teff; the corrections are especially significant for the infrared C I lines
with wavelengths 9060-9660 \AA. The carbon underabundance as a general property
of the stars in question is confirmed; a majority of the stars studied has the
carbon deficiency [C/Fe] between -0.1 and -0.5 dex, with a minimum at -0.7 dex.
When comparing the derived C deficiency with the N excess found by us for the
same stars earlier, we obtain a pronounced N vs. C anti-correlation, which
could be expected from predictions of the theory.We found that the ratio [N/C]
spans mostly the range from 0.3 to 1.7 dex. Both these enhanced [N/C] values
and the C and N anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence on
a star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority of
programme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (MS)
and/or the first dredge-up (FD) phase. Comparison with theoretical predictions
including rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-MS
objects with the initial rotational velocities V0 = 200-300 km/s or post-FD
objects with V0 = 0-300 km/s. The observed N vs. C anti-correlation reflects a
dependence of the C and N anomalies on the V0 value: on average the higher V0
the greater the anomalies. It is shown that an absence of detectable lithium in
the atmospheres of the stars, which is accompanied with the observed N excess
and C deficiency, is quite explainable.

[TD-CASSCF; Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 88}, 023402 (2013)], which divides the occupied
orbitals into core and active orbitals, the TD-ORMAS method {\it further}
subdivides the active orbitals into an arbitrary number of subgroups, and poses
the {\it occupation restriction} by giving the minimum and maximum number of
electrons distributed in each subgroup. This enables highly flexible
construction of the configuration interaction (CI) space, allowing a
large-active-space simulation of dynamics, e.g., the core excitation or
ionization. The equations of motion both for CI coefficients and spatial
orbitals are derived based on the time-dependent variational principle, and an
efficient algorithm is proposed to solve for the orbital time derivatives.
In-depth descriptions of the computational implementation are given in a
readily programmable manner. The numerical application to the one-dimensional
lithium hydride cluster models demonstrates that the high flexibility of the
TD-ORMAS framework allows for the cost-effective simulations of multielectron
dynamics, by exploiting systematic series of approximations to the TD-CASSCF

  battery electrode particles","  Volumetric expansion of silicon anode particles in a lithium-ion battery
during charging may lead to the generation of undesirable internal stresses.
For a cylindrical particle such growth may also lead to failure by buckling if
the expansion is constrained in the axial direction due to other particles or
supporting structures. To mitigate this problem, the possibility of reducing
axial growth is investigated theoretically by studying simple modifications of
the solid cylinder geometry. First, an annular cylinder is considered with
lithiation either from the inside or from the outside. In both cases, the
reduction of axial growth is not found to be significant. Next, explicit
physical constraints are studied by addition of a non-growing elasto-plastic
material: first, an outer annular constraint on a solid silicon cylinder, and
second a rod-like inner constraint for an annular silicon cylinder. In both
cases, it is found that axial growth can be reduced if the yield stress of the
constraining material is significantly higher than that of silicon and/or the
thickness of the constraint is relatively high. Phase diagrams are presented
for both the outer and the inner constraint cases to identify desirable
operating zones. Finally, to interpret the phase diagrams and isolate the key
physical principles two different simplified models are presented and are shown
to recover important qualitative trends of the numerical simulation results.

functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed in the present study to
investigate the solvation of lithium cations in pure organic carbonate solvents
(ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC) and dimethyl carbonate
(DMC)) and their binary (EC-DMC, 1:1 molar composition) and ternary (EC-DMC-PC,
1:1:3 molar composition) mixtures. The results obtained by both methods
indicate that the formation of complexes with four solvent molecules around
Li+, exhibiting a strong local tetrahedral order, is the most favorable.
However, the molecular dynamics simulations have revealed the existence of
significant structural heterogeneities, extending up to a length scale which is
more than five times the size of the first coordination shell radius. Due to
these significant structural fluctuations in the bulk liquid phases, the use of
larger size clusters in DFT calculations has been suggested. Contrary to the
findings of the DFT calculations on small isolated clusters, the MD simulations
have predicted a preference of Li+ to interact with DMC molecules within its
first solvation shell and not with the highly polar EC and PC ones, in the
binary and ternary mixtures. This behavior has been attributed to the local
tetrahedral packing of the solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of
Li+, which causes a cancellation of the individual molecular dipole vectors,
and this effect seems to be more important in the cases where molecules of the
same type are present. Due to these cancellation effects, the total dipole in
the first solvation shell of Li+ increases when the local mole fraction of DMC
is high.

that they can no more absorb light from the resonant light source. Now in
presence of a RF signal, which quantifies the ambient magnetic field, this
polarized atomic system is again randomized thus making it reabsorb the

surrounding the thin film detector. This is then mapped to the presence of
magnetic HEM and hence the HEM are detected. Our approach in this regard starts
with verifying the stability of Lithium atoms in various solvents so as to get
a suitable liquid medium to form a thin film. In this regard, various
UV-visible characterization spectra are presented to finally approach a stable
system for the detection. We have worked on around 10 polar and non- polar

Further results on the atomic system size as dispersed in the various solvents

effective self-defocusing nonlinearity so solitons can directly be generated at
common ultrafast laser wavelengths without any waveguide dispersion
engineering. We here experimentally demonstrate efficient SCG in a standard
lithium niobate (LN) waveguide without using quasi-phase matching (QPM). By
using femtosecond pumps with wavelengths in the $1.25-1.5 \mu\rm m$ range,
where LN has normal dispersion and thus supports self-defocusing solitons,
octave-spanning SCG is observed. An optimized mid-IR waveguide design is
expected to support even broader spectra. The QPM-free design reduces
production complexity, allows longer waveguides, limits undesired spectral
resonances and effectively allows using nonlinear crystals where QPM is
inefficient or impossible. This result is important for mid-IR SCG, where
QPM-free self-defocusing waveguides in common mid-IR nonlinear crystals can

battery cathodes because of their high theoretical capacities. The practical
application of these materials is, however, limited due to poor electrochemical
performance. We herein report a comprehensive first-principles study of defect
physics in LiMnO$_2$ and Li$_2$MnO$_3$ using hybrid-density functional
calculations. We find that manganese antisites have low formation energies in
LiMnO$_2$ and may act as nucleation sites for the formation of impurity phases.
The antisites can also occur with high concentrations in Li$_2$MnO$_3$;
however, unlike in LiMnO$_2$, they can be eliminated by tuning the experimental
conditions during preparation. Other intrinsic point defects may also occur and
have an impact on the materials' properties and functioning. An analysis of the
formation of lithium vacancies indicates that lithium extraction from LiMnO$_2$
is associated with oxidation at the manganese site, resulting in the formation
of manganese small hole polarons; whereas in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ the intrinsic
delithiation mechanism involves oxidation at the oxygen site, leading to the
formation of bound oxygen hole polarons $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$. The layered oxides
are found to have no or negligible bandlike carriers and they cannot be doped
n- or p-type. The electronic conduction proceeds through hopping of hole and/or
electron polarons; the ionic conduction occurs through lithium monovacancy
and/or divacancy migration mechanisms. Since $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$ is not stable
in the absence of negatively charged lithium vacancies in bulk Li$_2$MnO$_3$,
the electronic conduction near the start of delithiation is likely to be poor.
We suggest that the electronic conduction associated with $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$
and, hence, the electrochemical performance of Li$_2$MnO$_3$ can be improved
through nanostructuring and/or ion substitution.

these relics provide us a unique window on the early universe. Currently, BBN
simulations give acceptable agreement between theoretical and observed

The BBN model overestimates the primordial $^7$Li abundance by about a factor
of three, so called the cosmological lithium problem, a long-lasting pending
issue in BBN. Great efforts have been paid in the past decades, however, the
conventional nuclear physics seems unable to resolve such problem. It is
well-known that the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution has
been usually assumed for nuclei in the Big-Bang plasma. In this work, we have
thoroughly investigated the impact of non-extensive Tsallis statistics
(deviating from the MB) on thermonuclear reaction rates involved in standard

non-extensive parameter $q$. It is discovered that the velocities of nuclei in
a hot Big-Bang plasma indeed violate the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)
distribution in a very small deviation of about 6.3--8.2%. Thus, we have for
the first time found a new solution to the cosmological lithium problem without
introducing any mysterious theories. Furthermore, the implications of
non-extensive statistics in other exotic high-temperature and density
astrophysical environments should be explored, which might offer new insight

this secondary population are consistent with those of one of the components

Vela OB2 association. This population could have originally been part of a
cluster around $\gamma^2$ Velorum that expanded after gas expulsion or formed
in a less dense environment that is spread over the whole Vela OB2 region.

due to the stronger interaction of lithium with water molecules, partly due to
the lighter mass of lithium, and partly due to competing quantum effects in the
hydration of fluoride, which are absent in the hydration of lithium.

find that the model-predicted anode volume expansion and voltage profile agree
well with experiment, and a layered anode grain is highly-conductive and has a
theoretical reversible capacity of 4.5 Li atoms per a SnO host unit. The model
suggests that the grain structure has to remain layered to sustain its
reversible capacity and a thin-film design of battery anodes could be a remedy
for the capacity loss.

  application to the ""cosmological lithium problem""","  The standard theory of electromagnetic cascades onto a photon background
predicts a quasi-universal shape for the resulting non-thermal photon spectrum.
This has been applied to very disparate fields, including non-thermal big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). However, once the energy of the injected photons falls
below the pair-production threshold the spectral shape is very different, a
fact that has been overlooked in past literature. This loophole may have
important phenomenological consequences, since it generically alters the BBN
bounds on non-thermal relics: for instance it allows to re-open the possibility
of purely electromagnetic solutions to the so-called ""cosmological lithium

We show this with a proof-of-principle example and a simple particle physics

close to the red giant branch bump in a globular cluster. Through
intermediate-resolution FLAMES spectra we derived a lithium abundance of
A(Li)=2.55 (assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium), which is extremely
high considering the star's evolutionary stage. Kinematic and photometric
analysis confirm the object as a member of the globular cluster NGC 362. This
is the fourth Li-rich giant discovered in a globular cluster but the only one
known to exist at a luminosity close to the bump magnitude. The three previous
detections are clearly more evolved, located close to, or beyond the tip of
their red giant branch. Our observations are able to discard the accretion of
planets/brown dwarfs, as well as an enhanced mass-loss mechanism as a formation
channel for this rare object. Whilst the star sits just above the cluster bump
luminosity, its temperature places it towards the blue side of the giant branch
in the colour-magnitude diagram. We require further dedicated observations to
unambiguously identify the star as a red giant: we are currently unable to
confirm whether Li production has occurred at the bump of the luminosity
function or if the star is on the pre zero-age horizontal branch. The latter
scenario provides the opportunity for the star to have synthesised Li rapidly
during the core helium flash or gradually during its red giant branch ascent
via some extra mixing process.

abundance is overestimated by about a factor of 2--3 comparing to the
astronomical observations, so called the pending cosmological lithium problem.
The $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He reaction, which may affect the $^7$Li abundance,
was regarded as the secondary important reaction in destructing the $^7$Be
nucleus in BBN. However, the thermonuclear rate of $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He
has not been well studied so far. This reaction rate was firstly estimated by
Wagoner in 1969, which has been generally adopted in the current BBN
simulations and the reaction rate library. This simple estimation involved only
a direct-capture reaction mechanism, but the resonant contribution should be
also considered according to the later experimental results. In this work, we
have revised this rate based on the indirect cross-section data available for
the $^4$He($\alpha$,$n$)$^7$Be and $^4$He($\alpha$,$p$)$^7$Li reactions, with
the charge symmetry and detailed-balance principle. Our new result shows that
the previous rate (acting as an upper limit) is overestimated by about a factor
of ten. The BBN simulation shows that the present rate leads to a 1.2\%
increase in the final $^7$Li abundance compared to the result using the Wagoner
rate, and hence the present rate even worsens the $^7$Li problem. By the
present estimation, the role of $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He in destroying $^7$Be
is weakened from the secondary importance to the third, and the
$^7$Be($d$,$p$)2$^4$He reaction becomes of secondary importance in destructing
$^7$Be.

unsettled question in cosmology and astrophysics. Candidates environments of Li
production events or sites suggested by previous studies include big bang
nucleosynthesis, interactions of energetic cosmic rays with interstellar
matter, evolved low mass stars, novae, and supernova explosions. Chemical
evolution models and observed stellar Li abundances suggest that at least half
of the present Li abundance may have been produced in red giants, asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars, and novae. However, no direct evidence for the supply
of Li from stellar objects to the Galactic medium has yet been found. Here we
report on the detection of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of the singly
ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium, $^{7}$Be, in the near ultraviolet
(UV) spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013). Spectra were
obtained 38 to 48 days after the explosion. $^{7}$Be decays to form $^{7}$Li
within a short time (half-life 53.22 days). The spectroscopic detection of this
fragile isotope implies that it has been created during the nova explosion via
the reaction $^{3}\mbox{He}(\alpha,\gamma)^{7}\mbox{Be}$, and supports the
theoretical prediction that a significant amount of $^{7}$Li could be produced
in classical nova explosions. This finding opens a new way to explore $^{7}$Li
production in classical novae and provides a clue to the mystery of the
Galactic evolution of lithium.

migrate across the cell and relates to their solvation structure. The choice of
solvent can greatly impact both solvation and diffusivity of Li ions. We use
first principles molecular dynamics to examine the solvation and diffusion of
Li ions in the bulk organic solvents ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl
carbonate (EMC), and a mixture of EC/EMC. We find that Li ions are solvated by
either carbonyl or ether oxygen atoms of the solvents and sometimes by the
PF$_6^-$ anion. Li$^+$ prefers a tetrahedrally-coordinated first solvation
shell regardless of which species are involved, with the specific preferred
solvation structure dependent on the organic solvent. In addition, we calculate
Li diffusion coefficients in each electrolyte, finding slightly larger
diffusivities in the linear carbonate EMC compared to the cyclic carbonate EC.
The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient correlates with the strength of
Li$^+$ solvation. Corresponding analysis for the PF$_6^-$ anion shows greater
diffusivity associated with a weakly-bound, poorly defined first solvation
shell. These results may be used to aid in the design of new electrolytes to
improve Li-ion battery performance.

(Li-ion) batteries is discussed. First, a complete mathematical model based on
a macro-homogeneous approach developed by Neuman is presented. Two common
mistakes found in the literature regarding a sign in a boundary conditions and
the use of the transfer coefficient are mentioned. The paper focuses on the
form of the Butler-Volmer equation in the model. It is shown how practical
problems can be avoided by taking care in the form used, particularly to avoid
difficulties when the solid particle in the electrodes approaches a fully
charged or discharged state or the electrolyte gets depleted. This shows that
the open circuit voltage and the exchange current density must depend on the
lithium concentration in both the solid and the electrolyte in a particular way
at the extremes of the concentration ranges.

  NGC 362","  The presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been well
established thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. It is widely accepted that
distinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:
intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistry
observed in almost all clusters. Unfortunately, the progenitors responsible
have left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. To
constrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminium
abundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: NGC~1904, NGC~2808,
and NGC~362. The present investigation along with our previous analysis of M12
and M5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of Li and
Al abundances. Our results indicate that Li production has occurred in each of
the three clusters. In NGC~362 we detected an M12-like behaviour, with first
and second-generation stars sharing very similar Li abundances favouring a
progenitor that is able to produce Li, such as AGB stars. Multiple progenitor
types are possible in NGC~1904 and NGC~2808, as they possess both an
intermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars and
also an extreme population, that is enriched in Al but depleted in Li. A simple
dilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. Finally, the internal
Li variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element is
a function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relatively
metal-rich clusters are more adept at producing Li.

constructed in terms of the physical quantity of interest itself, for example
the density. Therefore, the calculation of important properties such as total
energies or photoemission spectra requires the solution of non-linear equations
that have unphysical and physical solutions. In this work we show in which
circumstances one runs into an unphysical solution, and we indicate how one can
overcome this problem. Moreover, we solve the puzzle of when and why the
interacting Green's function does not unambiguously determine the underlying
system, given in terms of its potential, or non-interacting Green's function.
Our results are general since they originate from the fundamental structure of
the equations. The absorption spectrum of lithium fluoride is shown as one
illustration, and observations in the literature for some widely used models
are explained by our approach. Our findings apply to both the weak and
strong-correlation regimes. For the strong-correlation regime we show that one
cannot use the expressions that are obtained from standard perturbation theory,

obtained Be abundances by spectral synthesis of the Be II 313 nm doublet. The
derived beryllium abundances exhibit no significant variation with age. The
more fragile Li, however, exhibits a monotonically decreasing abundance with
increasing age. Therefore, relatively shallow extra mixing below the convection

  anion selection to increase nonaqueous Li-O$_2$ battery capacity","  Among the 'beyond Li-ion' battery chemistries, nonaqueous Li-O$_2$ batteries
have the highest theoretical specific energy and as a result have attracted
significant research attention over the past decade. A critical scientific
challenge facing nonaqueous Li-O$_2$ batteries is the electronically insulating
nature of the primary discharge product, lithium peroxide, which passivates the
battery cathode as it is formed, leading to low ultimate cell capacities.
Recently, strategies to enhance solubility to circumvent this issue have been
reported, but rely upon electrolyte formulations that further decrease the
overall electrochemical stability of the system, thereby deleteriously
affecting battery rechargeability. In this study, we report that a significant
enhancement (greater than four-fold) in Li-O$_2$ cell capacity is possible by
appropriately selecting the salt anion in the electrolyte solution. Using
$^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance and modeling, we confirm that this
improvement is a result of enhanced Li$^+$ stability in solution, which in turn
induces solubility of the intermediate to Li$_2$O$_2$ formation. Using this
strategy, the challenging task of identifying an electrolyte solvent that
possesses the anti-correlated properties of high intermediate solubility and
solvent stability is alleviated, potentially providing a pathway to develop an
electrolyte that affords both high capacity and rechargeability. We believe the
model and strategy presented here will be generally useful to enhance Coulombic
efficiency in many electrochemical systems (e.g. Li-S batteries) where
improving intermediate stability in solution could induce desired mechanisms of
product formation.

discrepancies between the ages of exoplanet host stars estimated using stellar
models (isochronal ages) and age estimates based on the stars' rotation periods
(gyrochronological ages). We have compiled a sample of 28 transiting exoplanet
host stars with measured rotation periods. We use a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo method to determine the joint posterior distribution for the mass and age
of each star in the sample, and extend this method to include a calculation of
the posterior distribution of the gyrochronological age. The gyrochronological
age ($\tau_{\rm gyro}$) is significantly less than the isochronal age for about
half of the stars in our sample. Tidal interactions between the star and planet
are a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in some cases, but not all.
The distribution of $\tau_{\rm gyro}$ values is evenly spread from very young
ages up to a maximum value of a few Gyr. There is no clear correlation between
$\tau_{\rm gyro}$ and the strength of the tidal force on the star due to the
innermost planet. There is clear evidence that the isochronal ages for some
K-type stars are too large, and this may also be the case for some G-type
stars. This may be the result of magnetic inhibition of convection. There is
currently no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the young age
for CoRoT-2 estimated from either gyrochronology or its high lithium abundance,
and the extremely old age for its K-type stellar companion inferred from its
very low X-ray flux. There is now strong evidence that the gyrochronological
ages of some transiting exoplanet host stars are significantly less than their
isochronal ages, but it is not always clear that this is good evidence for
tidal interactions between the star and the planet.

predictive power. Data from medium-to-high resolution spectroscopic surveys of
lithium allow us to investigate first dredge-up and extra mixing in two
clusters well separated in metallicity. Abundances at first dredge-up are
satisfactorily reproduced but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that the
models overestimate the luminosity at which the surface composition first
changes in the lowest-metallicity system. Our models also begin extra mixing at
luminosities that are too high, demonstrating a significant discrepancy with
observations at low metallicity. We model the abundance changes during extra
mixing as a thermohaline process and determine that the usual diffusive form of
this mechanism cannot simultaneously reproduce both the carbon and lithium
observations. Hubble Space Telescope photometry provides turnoff and bump
magnitudes in a large number of globular clusters and offers the opportunity to
better test stellar modelling as function of metallicity. We directly compare
the predicted main-sequence turn-off and bump magnitudes as well as the
distance-independent parameter $\Delta M_V ~^{\rm{MSTO}}_{\rm{bump}}$. We
require 15 Gyr isochrones to match the main-sequence turn-off magnitude in some

distance modulus, metallicity scale and bolometric corrections may impact on
the direct comparisons but $\Delta M_V ~^{\rm{MSTO}}_{\rm{bump}}$, which is
also underestimated from the models, can only be improved through changes to

affecting the age at the lithium depletion boundary (LDB). To do that we
computed almost 12000 pre-main sequence models with mass in the range [0.06,
0.4] M_sun by varying input physics (nuclear reaction cross-sections, plasma
electron screening, outer boundary conditions, equation of state, and radiative
opacity), initial chemical elements abundances (total metallicity, helium and
deuterium abundances, and heavy elements mixture), and convection efficiency
(mixing length parameter, alpha_ML). As a first step, we studied the effect of
varying these quantities individually within their extreme values. Then, we
analysed the impact of simultaneously perturbing the main input/parameters
without an a priori assumption of independence. Such an approach allowed us to
build for the first time the cumulative error stripe, which defines the edges
of the maximum uncertainty region in the theoretical LDB age. We found that the
cumulative error stripe is asymmetric and dependent on the adopted mixing
length value. For alpha_ML = 1.00, the positive relative age error ranges from
5 to 15 per cent, while for solar-calibrated mixing length, the uncertainty
reduces to 5-10 per cent. A large fraction of such an error (about 40 per cent)
is due to the uncertainty in the adopted initial chemical elements abundances.

K00372.01), a giant transiting exoplanet orbiting a solar-analogue G2 V star.
The mass of Kepler-539b was accurately derived thanks to a series of precise
radial velocity measurements obtained with the CAFE spectrograph mounted on the
CAHA 2.2m telescope. A simultaneous fit of the radial-velocity data and Kepler
photometry revealed that Kepler-539b is a dense Jupiter-like planet with a mass
of Mp = 0.97 Mjup and a radius of Rp = 0.747 Rjup, making a complete circular
revolution around its parent star in 125.6 days. The semi-major axis of the
orbit is roughly 0.5 au, implying that the planet is at roughly 0.45 au from
the habitable zone. By analysing the mid-transit times of the 12 transit events
of Kepler-539b recorded by the Kepler spacecraft, we found a clear modulated
transit time variation (TTV), which is attributable to the presence of a planet
c in a wider orbit. The few timings available do not allow us to precisely
estimate the properties of Kepler-539c and our analysis suggests that it has a
mass between 1.2 and 3.6 Mjup, revolving on a very eccentric orbit (0.4<e<0.6)
with a period larger than 1000 days. The high eccentricity of planet c is the
probable cause of the TTV modulation of planet b. The analysis of the CAFE
spectra revealed a relatively high photospheric lithium content, A(Li)=2.48
dex, which, together with both a gyrochronological and isochronal analysis,
suggests that the parent star is relatively young.

  Implications on the early chemical evolution of galaxies","  In the course of the TOPoS (Turn Off Primordial Stars) survey, aimed at
discovering the lowest metallicity stars, we have found several carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We here present our analysis of six CEMP stars.
Calcium and carbon are the only elements that can be measured in all six stars.
The range is -5.0<=[Ca/H]< -2.1 and 7.12<=A(C)<=8.65. For star SDSS J1742+2531
we were able to detect three FeI lines from which we deduced [Fe/H]=-4.80, from
four CaII lines we derived [Ca/H]=-4.56, and from synthesis of the G-band we
derived A(C)=7.26. For SDSS J1035+0641 we were not able to detect any iron
lines, yet we could place a robust (3sigma) upper limit of [Fe/H]< -5.0 and
measure the Ca abundance, with [Ca/H]=-5.0, and carbon, A(C)=6.90. No lithium
is detected in the spectrum of SDSS J1742+2531 or SDSS J1035+0641, which
implies a robust upper limit of A(Li)<1.8 for both stars. Our measured carbon
abundances confirm the bimodal distribution of carbon in CEMP stars,
identifying a high-carbon band and a low-carbon band. We propose an
interpretation of this bimodality according to which the stars on the
high-carbon band are the result of mass transfer from an AGB companion, while
the stars on the low-carbon band are genuine fossil records of a gas cloud that
has also been enriched by a faint supernova (SN) providing carbon and the
lighter elements. (Abridged)

  Giant Stars","  Hydrocarbon organic material, as found in the interstellar medium, exists in
complex mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic forms. It is considered to be
originated from carbon enriched giant stars during their final stages of
evolution, when very strong mass loss occurs in a few thousand years on their
way to become planetary nebulae. We show here that the same organic compounds
appear to be formed in previous stages of the evolution of giant stars. More
specifically, during the first ascending giant branch K-type stars. According
to our model this happens only when these stars are being abruptly enriched
with lithium together with the formation of a circumstellar shell with a strong
mass loss during just a few thousand years. This sudden mass loss is, on an
average, a thousand times larger than that of normal Li-poor K giant stars.
This shell would later be detached, specially when the star stops its Li
enrichment and a rapid photospheric Li depletion occurs. In order to gain extra
carbon-based material to form the organic hydrocarbons, and also to explain the
presence of complex inorganic compounds in these stars, we propose an
interaction of these strong winds with remaining asteroidal/cometary disks that
already existed around these stars since they were dwarf A-type stars. The
mechanism of interaction presented here is successful to explain the presence
of inorganic compounds, however it is unable to produce new carbon free atoms
to form the organic hydrocarbon compounds. Finally, we discuss some suggestions
and speculations that can eventually help solving the long-standing puzzle of
Li-rich giants.

The contribution of novae to these phenomena depends on nova rates, which are
not well established for the Galaxy. Here, we directly measure a Galactic bulge
nova rate of $13.8 \pm 2.6$ per year. This measurement is much more accurate
than any previous measurement of this kind thanks to many years' monitoring of
the bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. Our
sample consists of 39 novae eruptions, $\sim$1/3 of which are OGLE-based
discoveries. This long-term monitoring allows us to not only measure the nova
rate but also to study in detail the light curves of 39 eruptions and more than
80 post-nova candidates. We measured orbital periods for 9 post-novae and 9
novae, and in 14 cases we procured the first estimates. The OGLE survey is very
sensitive to the frequently erupting recurrent novae. We did not find any
object similar to M31 2008-12a, which erupts once a year. The lack of detection
indicates that there is only a small number of them in the Galactic bulge.

an M7.5+/-0.5 and L7+/-1.5, respectively. The primary shows weaker alkali lines
than field dwarfs of similar spectral type, but still consistent with either a
high-gravity dwarf or a younger object of hundreds of millions of years. The
secondary shows spectral features characteristic for low surface gravity
objects at ages below several hundred Myr, like the triangular shape of the
H-band continuum and alkali lines weaker than in field dwarfs of the same
spectral type. The absence of lithium in the atmosphere of the primary and the
likely membership to the Local Association allowed us to constrain the age of
the system to the range of 150-300 Myr. We report a measurement of the
trigonometric parallax pi=78.8+/-6.4 mas, which translates into a distance of
12.7+/-1.0 pc; the pair thus has a projected physical separation of 102+/-9 AU.
We derived the Lbol of the components and compared them with theoretical
evolutionary models to estimate the masses and effective temperatures. For the
primary, we determined log(Lbol/LSun)=-3.14+/-0.10, and a mass of 73 (+20,-15}

effective temperature derived from evolutionary models is 880 (+140,-110) K,
about 400-700 K cooler than expected for field late-L dwarfs.

neutron diffraction techniques in the temperature range 300 - 1100 K. Detailed
Rietveld analyses of thermo-diffractograms show a variety of structural phase
transitions ranging from non-polar antiferrodistortive to ferroelectric in
nature. In the temperature range of 525 K to 675 K, unambiguous experimental
evidence is shown for phase coexistence of orthorhombic paraelectric O1 phase
(space group Cmcm) and orthorhombic ferroelectric O2 phase (space group Pmc21).
The bp primitive lattice parameter of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase (O2
phase) decreases, while the ap and cp primitive lattice parameters show normal
increase with increase in temperature. Above 675 K, in the O1 phase, all
lattice parameters come close to each other and increase continuously with
increase of temperature, and around 925 K, ap parameter approaches bp parameter
and thus the sample undergoes an orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition.
Further as temperature increases, the cp lattice parameter decreases, and
finally approaches to ap parameter, and the sample transform into the cubic
phase. The continuous change in the lattice parameters reveals that the
successive phase transformations from orthorhombic O1 to high temperature
tetragonal phase and finally to the cubic phase are not of a strong first order
type in nature. We argue that application of chemical pressure as a result of
Li substitution in NaNbO3 matrix, favours the freezing of zone centre phonons

  asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints","  Context. The availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample of
red giant stars from the CoRoT and Kepler missions paves the way for various
statistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.
  Aims. We use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 CoRoT red-giant
stars (Morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models to
observations of the open cluster NGC 6633 and field stars.
  Methods. In order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing and
thermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopic
ratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. These chemicals are
sensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.
  Results. We estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using the
seismic constraints. We note that the Hipparcos and seismic distances are
different. However, the uncertainties are such that this may not be
significant. Although the seismic distances for the cluster members are self
consistent they are somewhat larger than the Hipparcos distance. This is an
issue that should be considered elsewhere. Models including thermohaline
instability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismically
determined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.
However, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of the
current stellar models. Tighter constraints on the physics of the models would
require the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of the
period spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. A larger number of stars with
longer times series, as provided by Kepler or expected with Plato, would help
for ensemble asteroseismology.

composed of seven frequency components and then trap atoms with a number of
$6.0\times10^8$ which is about 4 times compared to that in the single-frequency
cooling. The capture velocity and dependence of atomic number on the laser
detuning have been analyzed, where the experimental result has a good agreement
with the theoretical prediction based on a simple two-level model. We also
analyze the loss rate of alkali metals due to fine-structure exchanging

lithium.

components incorporating recently published high-precision radial velocity
measurements, and a new detailed chemical analysis providing abundances for
more than 20 elements in both stars. We obtain highly precise (to about 0.3%)
masses of 2.5687 +/- 0.0074 and 2.4828 +/- 0.0067 solar masses, radii of 11.98

excellent match to stellar evolution models at the measured composition of
[Fe/H] = -0.04 +/- 0.06. Three different sets of models place the primary star
firmly at the end of the core helium-burning phase (clump), while the secondary
is known to be evolving rapidly across the Hertzprung gap. The measured lithium
abundance, the C/N ratio, and the 12C/13C isotopic carbon abundance ratio,
which change rapidly in the giant phase, are broadly in agreement with
expectations from models. Predictions from tidal theory for the spin rates,

40-fold increase in the efficiency of the dissipation mechanisms in order to
match the observations.

precise cross section data at E = 0.5-1.0 MeV center-of-mass energy. However,
there is a scarcity of precise data at Big Bang energies, 0.1-0.5 MeV, and

(LIBs) is presented in order to study the effects of parametric model
uncertainties on the cell capacity, voltage, and concentrations. To this end,
the proposed uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach, based on sparse
polynomial chaos expansions, relies on a small number of battery simulations.
Within this UQ framework, the identification of most important uncertainty
sources is achieved by performing a global sensitivity analysis via computing
the so-called Sobol' indices. Such information aids in designing more efficient
and targeted quality control procedures, which consequently may result in
reducing the LIB production cost. An LiC$_6$/LiCoO$_2$ cell with 19 uncertain
parameters discharged at 0.25C, 1C and 4C rates is considered to study the
performance and accuracy of the proposed UQ approach. The results suggest that,
for the considered cell, the battery discharge rate is a key factor affecting
not only the performance variability of the cell, but also the determination of
most important random inputs.

that heavily spotted models of mass 0.1-1.2\msun\ are inflated by up to $10$%
during the pre-MS, and up to 4% and 9% for fully- and partially-convective
stars at the zero-age MS, consistent with measurements from active eclipsing
binary systems. Spots similarly decrease stellar luminosity and $T_{\rm eff}$,
causing isochrone-derived masses to be under-estimated by up to a factor of $2
\times$, and ages to be under-estimated by a factor of 2-10$\times$, at 3 Myr.
Consequently, pre-MS clusters and their active stars are systematically older
and more massive than often reported. Cluster ages derived with the lithium
depletion boundary technique are erroneously young by $\sim 15$% and $10$% at
$30$ and $100$ Myr respectively, if 50% spotted stars are interpreted with
un-spotted models. Finally, lithium depletion is suppressed in spotted stars
with radiative cores, leading to a fixed-temperature lithium dispersion on the
MS if a range of spot properties are present on the pre-MS. Such dispersions
are large enough to explain Li abundance spreads seen in young open clusters,
and imply a range of radii at fixed mass and age during the pre-MS Li burning
epoch. By extension, this implies that mass, composition, and age do not
uniquely specify the HR diagram location of pre-MS stars.

non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation for Fe I and Fe II in
the classical 1D model atmospheres. The spectroscopic method was tested with

infrared flux method (IRFM) Teff and their Hipparcos parallax error is < 10%.
We found NLTE abundances from lines of Fe I and Fe II to be consistent within
0.06 dex for every benchmark star, when applying a scaling factor of S_H = 0.5
to the Drawinian rates of inelastic Fe+H collisions. The obtained atmospheric
parameters were checked for each program star by comparing its position in the
log g-Teff plane with the theoretical evolutionary track in the Yi et al.
(2004) grid. Our final effective temperatures lie in between the T_IRFM scales
of Alonso et al. (1996) and Casagrande et al. (2011), with a mean difference of
+46 K and -51 K, respectively. NLTE leads to higher surface gravity compared
with that for LTE. The shift in log g is smaller than 0.1 dex for stars with
either [Fe/H] > -0.75, or Teff < 5750 K, or log g > 4.20. NLTE analysis is
crucial for the VMP turn-off and subgiant stars, for which the shift in log g
between NLTE and LTE can be up to 0.5 dex. The obtained atmospheric parameters

O-rich Miras are as young as $2\times 10^8$ yrs. One of these has a lithium
absorption line in its spectrum, demonstrating that it is undergoing hot bottom
burning (HBB). This supports the idea that HBB is the cause of the high
luminosity of these AGB stars, which puts them above the fundamental
period-luminosity (PL) relation. Further studies of similar stars, selected
from their positions in the PL diagram, could provide insight into HBB. A much
fainter, presumed O-rich, Mira is similar to those found in Galactic globular
clusters. The C Miras are of intermediate age.
  The O-rich variables are not all recognized as O-rich, or even as AGB stars,
on the basis of their J-Ks colour. It is important to appreciate this when
using near-infrared surveys to classify AGB stars in more distant galaxies.

associated with the rotational modulation, oscillations, and variability of
stars located in the CoRoT fields, we are conducting a spectroscopic survey for
stars located in the fields already observed by the satellite. These
observations allow us to compute physical and chemical parameters for our
stellar sample. Method: Using spectroscopic observations obtained with UVES/VLT
and Hydra/Blanco, and based on standard analysis techniques, we computed
physical and chemical parameters ($T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log \,(g)$, $\rm{[Fe/H]}$,
$v_{\rm{mic}}$, $v_{\rm{rad}}$, $v \sin \,(i)$, and $A(\rm{Li})$) for a large
sample of CoRoT targets. Results: We provide physical and chemical parameters
for a sample comprised of 138 CoRoT targets. Our analysis shows the stars in
our sample are located in different evolutionary stages, ranging from the main
sequence to the red giant branch, and range in spectral type from F to K. The
physical and chemical properties for the stellar sample are in agreement with
typical values reported for FGK stars. However, we report three stars
presenting abnormal lithium behavior in the CoRoT fields. These parameters
allow us to properly characterize the intrinsic properties of the stars in
these fields. Our results reveal important differences in the distributions of
metallicity, $T_{\rm eff}$, and evolutionary status for stars belonging to
different CoRoT fields, in agreement with results obtained independently from
ground-based photometric surveys. Conclusions: Our spectroscopic catalog, by
providing much-needed spectroscopic information for a large sample of CoRoT
targets, will be of key importance for the successful accomplishment of several
different programs related to the CoRoT mission, thus it will help further
boost the scientific return associated with this space mission.

MGs, 8 that do not appear associated with any young MG and a further 7 that are
close to the kinematics of the recently proposed ""Octans-Near"" MG, and which

have been derived for 15 elements from Li to Eu based on high-resolution
spectra obtained with Subaru/HDS. The abundance patterns of both UMP stars are
consistent with the ""normal-population"" among the low-metallicity stars. Both
of the two program stars show carbon-enhancement without any excess of heavy
neutron-capture elements, indicating that they belong to the subclass of
CEMP-no stars, as is the case of most UMP stars previously studied. The [Sr/Ba]
ratios of both CEMP-no UMP stars are above [Sr/Ba]~-0.4, suggesting the origin
of the carbon-excess is not compatible with the mass transfer from an AGB
companion where the s-process has operated. Lithium abundance is measured in

J125346.09+075343.1 is slightly lower than the values obtained for less

times lower than the value of primordial Li predicted by the standard Big Bang
nucleosynthesis when the baryon density is taken from the CMB or the deuterium
measurements. This disagreement is generally referred as the lithium problem.
We here reconsider the stellar Li evolution from the pre-main sequence to the
end of the main sequence phase by introducing the effects of convective
overshooting and residual mass accretion. We show that $^7$Li could be
significantly depleted by convective overshooting in the pre-main sequence
phase and then partially restored in the stellar atmosphere by a tail of matter
accretion which follows the Li depletion phase and that could be regulated by
EUV photo-evaporation. By considering the conventional nuclear burning and
microscopic diffusion along the main sequence we can reproduce the Spite
plateau for stars with initial mass $m_0=0.62 - 0.80 M_{\odot}$, and the Li
declining branch for lower mass dwarfs, e.g, $m_0=0.57 - 0.60 M_{\odot}$, for a
wide range of metallicities (Z=0.00001 to Z=0.0005), starting from an initial
Li abundance $A({\rm Li}) =2.72$. This environmental Li evolution model also
offers the possibility to interpret the decrease of Li abundance in extremely
metal-poor stars, the Li disparities in spectroscopic binaries and the low Li
abundance in planet hosting stars.

literature. We present measurements of the lithium pseudo-equivalent widths,
which appears of similar strength on both components (8.2+/-1.0 Angstroms and
8.4+/-1.5 Angstroms for the L and T components, respectively). The presence of
lithium (Lithium 7) in both components imply masses below 0.06 Msun while
comparison with models suggests lower limits of 0.04 Msun. The detection of
lithium in the T component is the first of its kind. Similarly, we assess the
strength of other alkali lines (e.g. pseudo-equivalent widths of 6-7 Angstroms
for RbI and 4-7 Angstroms for CsI) present in the optical and near-infrared
regions and compare with estimates for L and T dwarfs. We also derive effective

that the L- and T-type spectra can be reproduced with a single temperature and
gravity but different relative chemical abundances which impact strongly the

passivation. We also distinguish the computed potential governing electrons,
which is the actual or instantaneous voltage, and the ""lithium cohesive energy""
based voltage governing Li content widely reported in DFT calculations, which
is a slower-responding self-consistency criterion at interfaces. This

Collected data show that HD 107028 is a star at the base of Red Giant Branch.
Except for high Li abundance, we have not identified any other anomalies in its
chemical composition, and there is no indication of a low mass or stellar
companion. We exclude Li production at the Luminosity Function Bump on RGB, as
the effective temperature and luminosity suggest that the evolutionary state is
much earlier than RGB Bump. We also cannot confirm the Li enhancement by
contamination, as we do not observe any anomalies that are associated with this

the Li-overabundance of HD 107028 originates from Main Sequence evolution, and

Waals interactions among two Rydberg atoms. The atoms are assumed to be in
different Rydberg states, e.g., in the $|ns\rangle$ and $|np\rangle$ states.
The resonant dipole-dipole interactions yield symmetric and antisymmetric
excitons, with energy splitting that give rise to new resonances as the atoms
approach each other. Only far from these resonances the van der Waals
coefficients, $C_6^{sp}$, can be defined. We calculate the $C_6$ coefficients
for alkali atoms and present the results for lithium by applying perturbation
theory. At short interatomic distances of several $\mu m$, we show that the
widely used simple model of two-level systems for excitons in Rydberg atoms
breaks down, and the correct representation implies multi-level atoms. Even
though, at larger distances one can keep the two-level systems but in including
van der Waals interactions among the atoms.

  principles calculations: accurate prediction of redox potentials and charge
  transfer in lithium transition metal oxides","  Transition metal (TM) oxides play an increasingly important role in
technology today including applications such as catalysis, solar energy
harvesting, and energy storage. In many of these applications, the details of
their electronic structure near the Fermi level are critically important for
their properties. We propose a first-principles based computational methodology
for the accurate prediction of oxygen charge transfer in TM oxides and lithium
TM (Li-TM) oxides. To obtain accurate electronic structures, the
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is adopted and the amount of
exact Hartree-Fock exchange (mixing parameter) is adjusted to reproduce
reference band gaps. We show that the HSE06 functional with optimal mixing
parameter yields not only improved electronic densities of states but also
better energetics (Li-intercalation voltages) for LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 as compared
to GGA, GGA+U and standard HSE06. We find that the optimal mixing parameters
for TM oxides are system-specific and correlate with the covalency (ionicity)
of the TM species. Strong covalent (ionic) nature of TM-O bonding leads to
lower (higher) optimal mixing parameters. We find that optimized HSE06
functionals predict stronger hybridization of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals than
GGA, resulting in a greater contribution from oxygen states to charge
compensation upon delithiation in LiCoO2. We also find that the band gaps of
Li-TM oxides increase linearly with the mixing parameter, enabling the
straightforward determination of optimal mixing parameters based on GGA
({\alpha} = 0.0) and HSE06 ({\alpha} = 0.25) calculations. Our results also
show that G0W0@GGA+U band gaps of TM oxides (MO, M = Mn, Co, Ni) and LiCoO2
agree well with experimental references, suggesting that G0W0 calculations can
be used as a reference for the calibration of the mixing parameter in case no
experimental band gap has been reported.

electron flux and the hard electron spectrum, the stellar flare of the similar

relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary models. This
consistency between the isochronal and LDB ages instills confidence that our

for models beyond the standard model (BSM). So far simplified models have
focused on topologies featuring a missing transverse energy (MET) signature.
However, in some BSM theories other, more exotic, signatures occur. If a
charged particle becomes long-lived on collider time scales - as it is the case
in parts of the SUSY parameter space - it leads to a very distinct signature.
We present an extension of the computer package SModelS which includes
simplified models for heavy stable charged particles (HSCP). As a physical
application we investigate the CMSSM stau co-annihilation strip containing
long-lived staus, which presents a potential solution to the Lithium problem.
Applying both MET and HSCP constraints we show that, for low values of
$\tan\beta$, all this region of parameter space either violates Dark Matter
constraints or is excluded by LHC searches.

charging/discharging rate capacity of Li-ion battery (LIB). Recently,
two-dimensional phosphorene has been proposed as a very promising electrode
material due to its ultrafast and directional lithium diffusion, as well as
large energy capacity. Here, on the basis of density functional theory, we
report that the intrinsic point defects, including vacancy and stone-wales
defects, will block the directional ultrafast diffusion of lithium in
phosphorene. On the defect-free phosphorene, diffusion of Li along the zigzag
lattice direction is 1.6 billion times faster than along the armchair lattice
direction, and 260 times faster than that in graphite. By introducing intrinsic
vacancy and stone-wales defect, the diffusion energy barrier of Li along zigzag
lattice direction increases sharply to the range of 0.17 ~ 0.49 eV, which block
the ultrafast migration of lithium along the zigzag lattice direction.
Meanwhile, the open circuit voltage increases with the emergence of defects,
which is not suitable for anode materials. In addition, the formation energies
of defects in phosphorene are much lower than those in graphene and silicene
sheet, therefore, it is highly demanded to generate defect-free phosphorene for
LIB applications.

have attracted much attention. Owing to the strong confinement of light in a
small volume, a WGM microresonator can dramatically boost the strength of light
field, thereby promoting the nonlinear interaction between the light and the
resonator material. However, realization of efficient nonlinear parametric
process in microresonators is a challenging issue. The major difficulty is to
simultaneously ensure the phase matching condition and a coherent multiple
resonance condition for all the waves participating in the nonlinear conversion
process. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG)
in an on-chip lithium niobate microresonator fabricated by femtosecond laser
direct writing. We overcome the difficulty of double resonance for the phase
matched pump and second harmonic waves by selectively exciting high order modes
in the fabricated thin-disk microresonator. Our technique opens opportunities
for integrated classical and quantum photonic applications.

  stellar system","  The 16 Cyg system is composed of two solar analogs with similar masses and
ages. A red dwarf is in orbit around 16 Cyg A whereas 16 Cyg B hosts a giant
planet. The abundances of heavy elements are similar in the two stars but
lithium is much more depleted in 16 Cyg B that in 16 Cyg A, by a factor of at
least 4.7. The interest of studying the 16 Cyg system is that the two star have
the same age and the same initial composition. The presently observed
differences must be due to their different evolution, related to the fact that
one of them hosts a planet contrary to the other one. We computed models of the
two stars which precisely fit the observed seismic frequencies. We used the
Toulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC) that includes complete atomic diffusion
(including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface
abundances with the spectroscopic observations and confirmed that another
mixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced
fingering convection. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the
metal abundances but leads to lithium destruction which depends on the accreted
mass. A fraction of earth mass is enough to explain the lithium surface
abundances of 16 Cyg B. We also checked the beryllium abundances. In the case
of accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements
do not remain in the outer convective zones but they are mixed downwards by
fingering convection induced by the unstable $\mu$-gradient. Depending on the
accreted mass, this mixing process may transport lithium down to its nuclear
destruction layers and lead to an extra lithium depletion at the surface. A
fraction of earth mass is enough to explain a lithium ratio of 4.7 in the 16
Cyg system. In this case beryllium is not destroyed. Such a process may be
frequent in planet host stars and should be studied in other cases in the
future.

leading to a dispersion in zero-age MS Li abundance (comparable to observed

This concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed

isochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can

sections, A and B, with different LN confinement factors (32% and 90%,
respectively) of the fundamental quasi TE mode. Such a large LN confinement
factor is achieved with adiabatic tapers that preserve the symmetry of the
fundamental quasi TE mode and prevent mode rotation. We find the average
propagation loss in cross section B to be 4.3 dB/cm with a standard deviation
of 2.1 dB/cm, comparable with a 3 um SiO2 clad (in place of LN) Si waveguide
whose average propagation loss was 3.1 dB/cm with a standard deviation of 2.1

  clusters","  We investigated the possibility of producing helium enhanced stars in
globular clusters by accreting polluted matter during the pre-main sequence
phase. We followed the evolution of two different classes of pre-main sequence
accreting models, one which neglects and the other that takes into account the
protostellar evolution.
  We analysed the dependence of the final central helium abundance, of the
tracks position in the HR diagram and of the surface lithium abundance
evolution on the age at which the accretion of polluted material begins and on
the main physical parameters that govern the protostellar evolution. The later
is the beginning of the late accretion and the lower are both the central
helium and the surface lithium abundances at the end of the accretion phase and
in ZAMS (Zero Age Main Sequence). In order to produce a relevant increase of
the central helium content the accretion of polluted matter should start at
ages lower than 1 Myr. The inclusion of the protostellar evolution has a strong
impact on the ZAMS models too. The adoption of a very low seed mass (i.e. 0.001
M$_{\odot}$) results in models with the lowest central helium and surface
lithium abundances. The higher is the accretion rate and the lower is the final
helium content in the core and the residual surface lithium. In the worst case
-- i.e. seed mass 0.001 M$_\odot$ and accretion rate $\ge 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ -- the central helium is not increased at all and the surface lithium
is fully depleted in the first few million years.

lithium-ion batteries due to its high lithium insertion voltage, 1.5 V;
moreover, BP exhibits a relatively low theoretical volume expansion compared
with other intercalation anodes, 216\% ($\Delta V/V$). We identify that
specific ranges in the calculated shielding can be associated with specific
ionic arrangements, results which play an important role in the interpretation
of NMR spectroscopy experiments. Since the lithium-phosphides are found to be
insulating even at high lithium concentrations we show that Li-P-doped phases
with aluminium have electronic states at the Fermi level suggesting that using
aluminium as a dopant can improve the electrochemical performance of P anodes.

three-dimensional spatio-temporal correlator (STC) that combines the techniques
of holographic correlation and photon echo based temporal pattern recognition.
The STC is shift invariant in space and time. It can be used to recognize
rapidly an event (e.g., a short video clip) that may be present in a large
video file, and determine the temporal location of the event. Using polar
Mellin transform, it is possible to realize an STC that is also scale and
rotation invariant spatially. Numerical simulation results of such a system are
presented using quantum mechanical equations of evolution. For this simulation
we have used the model of an idealized, decay-free two level system of atoms
with an inhomogeneous broadening that is larger than the inverse of the
temporal resolution of the data stream. We show how such a system can be
realized by using a lambda-type three level system in atomic vapor, via
adiabatic elimination of the intermediate state. We have also developed
analytically a three dimensional transfer function of the system, and shown
that it agrees closely with the results obtained via explicit simulation of the
atomic response. The analytical transfer function can be used to determine the
response of an STC very rapidly. In addition to the correlation signal, other
nonlinear terms appear in the explicit numerical model. These terms are also
verified by the analytical model. We describe how the AER can be operated in a
manner such that the correlation signal remains unaffected by the additional
nonlinear terms. We also show how such a practical STC can be realized using a
combination of a porous-glass based Rb vapor cell, a holographic video disc,
and a lithium niobate crystal.

standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. By means of the derived (D/H)$_{\rm p}$
value the baryon density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm b}h^2=0.0222\pm0.0013$
and the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta_{10} = 6.09\pm 0.36$ have been deduced.
These values have confident intervals which are less stringent than that
obtained for the {\it Precision Sample} and, thus, leave a broader window for
new physics. The latter is particularly important in the light of the lithium
problem.

storage such as lithium ion batteries. While it is generally assumed that the
conversion reaction is initiated by ion intercalation into the electrode
material, solid evidence of intercalation and the subsequent transition
mechanism to conversion remain elusive. Here, using well-defined WO3 single
crystalline thin films grown on Nb doped SrTiO3(001) as a model electrode, we
elucidate the conversion reaction mechanisms during Li+, Na+ and Ca2+ insertion
into WO3 by in situ transmission electron microscopy studies. Intercalation
reactions are explicitly revealed for all ion insertions. With corroboration
from first principle molecular simulations, it is found that, beyond
intercalation, ion-oxygen bonding destabilize the W framework, which gradually
collapses to pseudo-amorphous structure. In addition, we show the interfacial
tensile strain imposed by the SrTiO3 substrate can preserve the structure of an
ultra-thin layer of WO3, offering a possible engineering solution to improve
the cyclability of electrode materials. This study provides a detailed
atomistic picture on the conversion-type electrodes in secondary ion batteries.

stress evolution in the germanium thin-film electrodes during electrochemical

the multi-beam optical sensing method. Upon lithiation a-Ge undergoes extensive
plastic deformation, with a peak compressive stress reaching as high as -0.76
+/- 0.05 GPa (mean +/- standard deviation). The compressive stress decreases
with lithium concentration reaching a value of approximately -0.3 GPa at the
end of lithiation. Upon delithiation the stress quickly became tensile and
follows a trend that mirrors the behavior on compressive side; the average peak
tensile stress of the lithiated Ge samples was approximately 0.83 GPa. The peak
tensile stress data along with the SEM analysis was used to estimate a lower
bound fracture resistance of lithiated Ge, which is approximately 5.3 J/m^2. It
was also observed that the lithiated Ge is rate sensitive, i.e., stress depends
on how fast or slow the charging is carried out.

  interfaces in Li-Ion battery electrode particles","  To study the electrochemical reaction on surfaces, phase interfaces, and
crack surfaces in the lithium ion battery electrode particles, a phase-field
model is developed, which describes fracture in large strains and anisotropic
Cahn-Hilliard-Reaction. Thereby the concentration-dependency of the elastic
properties and the anisotropy of diffusivity are also considered. The
implementation in 3D is carried out by isogeometric finite element methods in
order to treat the high order terms in a straightforward sense. The
electrochemical reaction is modeled through a modified Butler-Volmer equation
to account for the influence of the phase change on the reaction on exterior
surfaces. The reaction on the crack surfaces is considered through a volume
source term weighted by a term related to the fracture order parameter. Based
on the model, three characteristic examples are considered to reveal the
electrochemical reactions on particle surfaces, phase interfaces, and crack
surfaces, as well as their influence on the particle material behavior. Results
show that the ratio between the timescale of reaction and the diffusion can
have a significant influence on phase segregation behavior, as well as the
anisotropy of diffusivity. In turn, the distribution of the lithium
concentration greatly influences the reaction on the surface, especially when
the phase interfaces appear on exterior surfaces or crack surfaces. The
reaction rate increases considerably at phase interfaces, due to the large
lithium concentration gradient. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the
segregation of a Li-rich and a Li-poor phase during delithiation can drive the
cracks to propagate. Results indicate that the model can capture the
electrochemical reaction on the freshly cracked surfaces.

bound Helium ($\alpha$), with Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron all clearly seen as
a function of collision centrality and pseudorapidity. We observe that in Cu+Cu
collisions, it becomes much more favorable for the $\alpha$ fragments to be
released than Lithium. The yields of fragments approximately scale with the
number of spectator nucleons, independent of the colliding ion. The shapes of
the pseudorapidity distributions of fragments indicate that the average
deflection of the fragments away from the beam direction increases for more
central collisions. A detailed comparison of the shapes for $\alpha$ and
Lithium fragments indicates that the centrality dependence of the deflections
favors a scaling with the number of participants in the collision.

Brillouin. We construct an alternative Brillouin zone defined by Bragg planes
and show its utility in identifying features of the dispersion bands. We show
that for an anisotropic 2D PhC without dispersion, the Bragg plane BZ can be
constructed by applying the Wigner-Seitz method to a stretched or compressed
reciprocal lattice. We also show that in the presence of the dispersion in the
underlying material or in a slab waveguide, the Bragg planes are generally

  G-band stars","  Weak G-band (wGb) stars are very peculiar red giants almost devoided of
carbon and often mildly enriched in lithium. Despite their very puzzling
abundance patterns, very few detailed spectroscopic studies existed up to a few
years ago, preventing any clear understanding of the wGb phenomenon. We
recently proposed the first consistent analysis of published data for 28 wGb
stars and identified them as descendants of early A-type to late B-type stars,
without being able to conclude on their evolutionary status or the origin of
their peculiar abundance pattern.
  We used newly obtained high-resolution and high SNR spectra for 19 wGb stars
in the southern and northern hemisphere to homogeneously derive their
fundamental parameters, metallicities, as well as the spectroscopic abundances
for Li, C, N, O, Na, Sr, and Ba. We also computed dedicated stellar evolution
models that we used to determine the masses and to investigate the evolutionary
status and chemical history of the stars in our sample. We confirm that the wGb
stars are stars in the mass range 3.2 to 4.2 M$_\odot$. We suggest that a large
fraction could be mildly evolved stars on the SGB currently undergoing the 1st
DUP, while a smaller number of stars are more probably in the core He burning
phase at the clump. After analysing their abundance pattern, we confirm their
strong N enrichment anti-correlated with large C depletion, characteristic of
material fully processed through the CNO cycle to an extent not known in other
evolved intermediate-mass stars. However, we demonstrate here that such a
pattern is very unlikely due to self-enrichment. In the light of the current
observational constraints, no solid self-consistent pollution scenario can be
presented either, leaving the wGb puzzle largely unsolved.

stellar rotation are measured as additional tracers of stellar mixing. One of
the companion hosts, NGC2423 3, is found to be Li-rich with A(Li)_NLTE=1.56

highest A(Li) and 12C/13C when compared to the control red giants in their

has similarly high abundances within the uncertainties. Higher A(Li) could
suggest that the formation or presence of planets plays a role in the degree of
internal mixing on or before the red giant branch. However, a multitude of
factors affect A(Li) during the red giant phase, and when the abundances of our
sample are compared to abundances of red giants in other open clusters
available in the literature, we find that they all fall well within a much
larger distribution of A(Li) and 12C/13C. Thus, even the high Li in NGC2423 3

  convection and NLTE effects","  Different simplified approaches are used to account for the non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects with 3D hydrodynamical model
atmospheres. In certain cases, chemical abundances are derived in 1D NLTE and
corrected for the 3D effects by adding 3D-1D LTE abundance corrections (3D+NLTE
approach). Alternatively, average <3D> model atmospheres are sometimes used to
substitute for the full 3D hydrodynamical models.
  We tested whether the results obtained using these simplified schemes (i.e.,
3D+NLTE, <3D> NLTE) may reproduce those derived using the full 3D NLTE
computations. The tests were made using 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model
atmospheres of the main sequence (MS), main sequence turn-off (TO), subgiant
(SGB), and red giant branch (RGB) stars, all at [M/H]=0.0 and -2.0. Our goal
was to investigate the role of 3D and NLTE effects on the formation of the
670.8 nm lithium line by assessing strengths of synthetic 670.8 nm line
profiles, computed using 3D/1D NLTE/LTE approaches.
  Our results show that Li 670.8 nm line strengths obtained using different
methodologies differ only slightly in most of the models at solar metallicity.
However, the line strengths predicted with the 3D NLTE and 3D+NLTE approaches
become significantly different at subsolar metallicities. At [M/H]=-2.0, this
may lead to (3D NLTE)-(3D+NLTE) differences in the predicted lithium abundance
of ~0.46 and ~0.31 dex in the TO and RGB stars, respectively. On the other
hand, NLTE line strengths computed with the average <3D> and 1D model
atmospheres are similar to those obtained with the full 3D NLTE approach for
MS, TO, SGB, and RGB stars, at all metallicities; 3D-<3D> and 3D-1D differences
in the predicted abundances are always less than ~0.04 dex and ~0.08 dex,
respectively. However, neither of the simplified approaches can reliably
substitute 3D NLTE spectral synthesis when precision is required.

through the Cameron-Fowler conveyor, but the existence of Li-rich, low-mass red
giant branch (RGB) stars is puzzling. Globular clusters are the best sites to
examine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership
in the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours
of Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two
Li-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or
upper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of
Li-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%
for the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars
are on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the
luminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB
stars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous
giants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All
post-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass
transfer. This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear
Li-rich due to mass transfer from a recently Li-enhanced companion. This
frequency is at the lower end of our confidence interval.

Hipparcos astrometric data and the development of a new geometric distance
measurement for the cluster. A short Pleiades distance from the Hipparcos
parallax predicts a number of stars in the solar neighborhood that are
sub-luminous at a given photospheric abundance. We test this hypothesis using
spectroscopic abundances for a subset of stars in the Hipparcos catalog, which
occupy the same region as the Pleiades in the color-magnitude diagram. We
derive stellar parameters for 170 nearby G and K type field dwarfs in the
Hipparcos catalog based on high-resolution spectra obtained using KPNO 4-m
echelle spectrograph. Our analysis shows that, when the Hipparcos parallaxes
are adopted, most of our sample stars follow empirical color-magnitude
relations. A small fraction of stars are too faint compared to main-sequence
fitting relations by $\Delta M_V \geq 0.3$ mag, but the differences are
marginal at a $2\sigma$ level partly due to relatively large parallax errors.
On the other hand, we find that photometric distances of stars showing
signatures of youth as determined from lithium absorption line strengths and
$R'_{\rm HK}$ chromospheric activity indices are consistent with the Hipparcos
parallaxes. Our result is contradictory to a suggestion that the Pleiades
distance from main-sequence fitting is significantly altered by stellar
activity and/or the young age of its stars, and provides an additional
supporting evidence for the long distance scale of the Pleiades.

(QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs,
is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence

a very good fit to the observed evolution of rotational periods for solar-type
stars from early evolution to the age of the Sun. Additionally, we show that
fast rotators experience a stronger coupling between their radiative region and
the convective envelope. Regardless of the set of prescriptions, however, we
cannot simultaneously reproduce surface angular velocity and the internal
profile of the Sun or the evolution of lithium abundance. We confirm the idea
that additional transport mechanisms must occur in solar-type stars until they
reach the age of the Sun. Whether these processes are the same as those needed
to explain recent asteroseismic data in more advanced evolutionary phases is
still an open question.

key for addressing both efficiency and safety issues. Although various
techniques have been developed to map the lithium distribution in electrodes,
these methods are mostly applicable to test cells. Here we propose the use of
high-energy x-ray Compton scattering spectroscopy to measure the local lithium
concentration in closed electrochemical cells. A combination of experimental
measurements and parallel first-principles computations is used to show that
the shape parameter S of the Compton profile is linearly proportional to
lithium concentration and thus provides a viable descriptor for this important
quantity. The merits and applicability of our method are demonstrated with
illustrative examples of LixMn2O4 cathodes and a working commercial lithium
coin battery CR2032.

  Piezoresponse-Force-Microscopy","  Piezoresponse force-microscopy (PFM) has become the standard tool to
investigate ferroelectrics on the micro- and nanoscale. However, reliability of
PFM signals is often problematic and their quantification is challenging and
thus not widely applied. Here, we present a study of the reproducibility of PFM
signals and of the so-called PFM background signal which has been reported in
literature. We find that PFM signals are generally reproducible to certain
extents. The PFM signal difference between 180{\deg} domains on
periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is taken as the reference signal in a
large number of measurements, carried out in a low frequency regime (30-70
kHz). We show that in comparison to Pt coated tips, diamond coated tips exhibit
improved signal stability, lower background signal and less imaging artifacts
related to PFM which is reflected in the spread of measurements. This is
attributed to the improved mechanical stability of the conductive layer. The
average deviation of the mean PFM signal is 38.3%, for a diamond coated tip.
Although this deviation is relatively high, it is far better than values from
literature which showed a deviation of approx. 73.1%. Additionally, we find
that the average deviation of the background signal from 0 is 11.6% of the PPLN
domain contrast. Thus, the background signal needs to be taken into account
when quantifying PFM signals and should be subtracted from PFM signals. Those
results are important for quantification of PFM signals, since PPLN might be
used for this purpose when PFM signals measured on PPLN are related to its
macroscopic d33 coefficient. Finally, the crucial influence of sample polishing
on PFM signals is shown and we recommend to use a multistep polishing route
with a final step involving 200 nm sized colloidal silica particles.

fluctuations due to the magnetic Tayler instability of a rotating axial pinch
is considered. Our study is carried out within a Taylor-Couette setup for two
rotation laws: quasi-Kepler and solid-body rotation. The minimum magnetic
Prandtl number used is 0.05 while the molecular Schmidt number Sc of the fluid
varies between 0.1 and 2. An effective diffusivity coefficient for the mixing
is numerically measured by the decay process of a global concentration peak
located between the cylinder walls. We find that only models with Sc>0.1 do
provide finite eddy diffusivity values. We also find that for quasi-Kepler
rotation at a magnetic Mach number Mm~2 the flow transits from the
slow-rotation regime to the fast-rotation regime. For fixed Reynolds number the
relation between the normalized eddy diffusivity and the Schmidt number of the
fluid is always linear so that also a linear relation between the
instability-induced diffusivity and the molecular viscosity results just in the
sense proposed by Schatzman (1977). The numerical value of the coefficient in
this relation will reach a maximum at Mm~2 and will decrease for Mm>>1 implying
that only toroidal magnetic fields of order kG can exist in the solar
tachocline.

of stellar age to provide constraints for stellar evolutions models and to
investigate whether there is a connection between low Li abundance and the
occurrence of planets. For a sample of 21 solar twins observed with the HARPS
spectrograph at high spectral resolution (R~115.000) and very high
signal-to-noise ratio (600 < S/N < 2400), precise lithium abundances were
obtained by spectral synthesis of the LiI 6707.8 A line and compared to stellar
ages, masses, and metallicities determined from a spectroscopic analysis of the
same set of HARPS spectra. We show that for the large majority of the solar
twins there is a strong correlation between lithium abundance and stellar age.
As the age increases from 1 to 9 Gyr, the Li abundance decreases by a factor of
~ 50. The relation agrees fairly well with predictions from non-standard
stellar evolution models of Li destruction at the bottom of the upper
convection zone. Two stars deviate from the relation by having Li abundances
enhanced by a factor of ~ 10, which may be due to planet engulfment. On the
other hand, we find no indication of a link between planet hosting stars and
enhanced lithium depletion.

do this we derive analytic interatomic potentials for the alkali metals fitted
precisely to cohesive and vacancy energies, elastic moduli, lattice parameter
and crystal stability. These potentials are then used to calculate melting
points by simulating the equilibration of solid and liquid samples in thermal
contact at ambient pressure. With the exception of lithium, remarkably good
agreement is found with experimental values. The instability of the bcc
structure in Li and Na at low temperatures is also reproduced, and, unusually,
is not due to a soft T1N phonon mode. No forces or finite temperature
properties are included in the fit, so this demonstrates a surprisingly high
level of intrinsic transferrability in the simple potentials. Currently, there
are few potentials available for the alkali metals, so in, addition to
demonstrating trends in behaviour, we expect that the potentials will be of
broad general use.

nowadays for computing neutral excitation energies and optical spectra of
crystalline systems from first principles. Bethe-Salpeter calculations yield
very good agreement with experiment but are notoriously difficult to converge
with respect to the sampling of the electronic wavevectors. Well-converged
spectra therefore require significant computational and memory resources, even
by today's standards. These bottlenecks hinder the investigation of systems of
great technological interest. They are also barriers to the study of derived
quantities like piezoreflectance, thermoreflectance or resonant Raman
intensities.
  We present a new methodology that decreases the workload needed to reach a
given accuracy. It is based on a double-grid on-the-fly interpolation within
the Brillouin zone, combined with the Lanczos algorithm. It achieves
significant speed-up and reduction of memory requirements. The technique is
benchmarked in terms of accuracy on silicon, gallium arsenide and lithium

Brillouin Zone point density is much better than a conventional implementation.

cannot be explained in terms of the standard stellar evolution theory. The goal
of our study is to check the reality of this group of cool giants based on an
independent technique. We have carried out such a check using the K giant HD
77361 (HR 3597), which has previously been assigned to this rare type, as an
example. We have redetermined the effective temperature Teff and surface
gravity log g for this star. We have applied two different methods, photometric
and spectroscopic, to estimate Teff (the accuracy of the Li-abundance
determination depends significantly on this parameter). The value of log g has
been found from the highly accurate parallax of this nearby star. To apply the
photometric method of determining Teff, we have performed UBV observations of
the star, which yielded V = 6.18 +/- 0.03, B - V = 1.13 +/- 0.01, and U - B =
1.18+/-0.05. The following parameters of the star have been found: effective
temperature Teff = 4370+/- 100 K, surface gravity log g = 2.30 +/- 0.10, iron
abundance log e(Fe) = 7.49 +/- 0.14, microturbulence Vt = 1.1 +/- 0.2 km/s,
rotational velocity V sin i = 4.5 km/s, and mass M = 1.3 +/- 0.2 Msun. The
lithium abundance has been determined from a non-LTE analysis of three Li I
lines: the resonance line at 6707.8 ?A and the subordinate lines at 6103.6 and
8126.4 ?A (the latter in a blend with a CN molecular line). We have found a
high lithium abundance, log e(Li) = 3.75 +/- 0.11, which exceeds considerably
the initial abundance log e(Li) = 3.2 +/- 0.1 for young stars in the solar
neighborhood. Thus, we have confirmed that the K giant HD 77361 actually
belongs to the type of super Li-rich stars.

the mismatch with respect to the \emph{dispatch plan} is corrected by applying
receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) to decide the BESS

the best kinematic conditions to measure the ${}^{2}{\rm

high-resolution (R $\approx$ 70000) spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N $\approx$ 400 - 650 per pixel) of HIP 100963 and the Sun for a
differential abundance analysis. We measured the equivalent widths (EWs) of
iron lines to determine the stellar parameters by employing the differential
spectroscopic equilibrium. We determined the composition of volatile,
refractory, and neutron-capture elements through a differential abundance
analysis with respect to the Sun.
  Results. The stellar parameters we found are $T_{\rm{eff}}=5818 \pm 4$ K, log
$g = 4.49 \pm 0.01$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.03 \pm 0.01 $ $\rm{km\ {s}}^{-1}$ , and
[Fe/H] $ = -\ 0.003 \pm 0.004$ dex. These low errors allow us to compute a
precise mass ($1.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$) and age (2.0 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr),
obtained using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. Using our [Y/Mg] ratio, we have
determined an age of $2.1 \pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the age computed
using isochrones. Our isochronal age also agrees with the age determined from
stellar activity (2.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Gyr). We study the abundance pattern with
condensation temperature ($\rm{T_{cond}}$) taking corrections by the GCE into
account. We show that the enhancements of neutron-capture elements are
explained by contributions from both the $s$- and $r$-process. The lithium
abundance follows the tight Li-age correlation seen in other solar twins.
  Conclusions. We confirm that HIP 100963 is a solar twin and demonstrate that
its abundance pattern is about solar after corrections for GCE. The star also
shows enrichment in $s-$ and $r$-process elements, as well as depletion in
lithium that is caused by stellar evolution.

neutron scattering measurements in beta eucryptite over 300 to 900 K and
calculated the phonon spectrum using ab initio density functional theory
method. The calculated energy profile for cooperative lithium ion displacements
indicates preferential movement of Li ion along the hexagonal c-axis in the
high temperature phase. However, the energy barrier for Li ion diffusion is
significantly reduced when a Schottky defect is introduced in the crystal.
Further, the anisotropic stress dependence of the phonon spectrum is calculated
to obtain the thermal expansion behavior along various axes. The calculations
show that the Gruneisen parameters of the low-energy phonon modes around 10 meV
have large negative values and govern the negative thermal expansion behavior
both along the a and c axes. On the other hand, anisotropic elasticity along
with anisotropic positive values of the Gruneisen parameters of the high-energy
modes in the range 30 to 70 meV are responsible for positive thermal expansion
in the a-b plane and negative expansion along the c-axis. The analysis of the
polarization vectors of the phonon modes sheds light on the mechanism of the
anomalous thermal expansion behavior. We extend the study to discuss the
relationship of the soft phonons in the Brillouin zone with the observed
high-pressure and high-temperature phase transitions as reported in the

Universe is in discordance with the observed Li abundances in warm Population
II dwarf and subgiant stars. Among the physically best motivated ideas, it has
been suggested that this discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed
today had undergone photospheric depletion of lithium. The cause of this
depletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium
abundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal
laboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters
of their stars can be precisely determined. We performed a homogeneous chemical
abundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging
from the cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. NLTE
abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived where possible. Stellar parameters
were derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V-I colour-magnitude
diagram. Independent effective temperatures were obtained from automated
profile fitting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-T_eff calibrations
to the broadband photometry. Li abundances of the turnoff and early subgiant
stars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the middle of the SGB
as a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up.
Abundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and Ca are observed and
compared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic
diffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the surface convection zone. The
comparison shows that the stars in M30 are affected by atomic diffusion and
additional mixing. After applying a conservative correction for atomic
diffusion, we find an initial Li abundance of A(Li) = $2.48\pm0.10$ for the
globular cluster M30.

tunnel through the barrier and fuse, can be supplied by external
electromagnetic waves (X-rays or the synchrotron radiation). Exposing to the
X-rays the solid compound LiD (lithium-deuteride) for the duration of 111
hours, we have detected 88 events of the nuclear fusion d+Li6 ---> Be8*. Our
theoretical estimate agrees with what we observed. One of possible applications
of the phenomenon we found, could be the measurements of the rates of various
nuclear reactions (not necessarily fusion) at extremely low energies
inaccessible in accelerator experiments.

be seen as {\epsilon}-O8 accepting two electrons from two Li atoms. This phase
is superconducting, with Tc up to 12.2 K at 10 GPa. This is remarkable, because
elemental oxygen becomes superconducting at much higher pressure (96 GPa) and
has much lower Tc (<0.6 K), and suggests that chemical alloying with other
elements has the potential of not only decreasing metallization pressure, but
also of increasing Tc. Since {\epsilon}-O8 is called red oxygen, LiO4 can be
identified ""lithium red-oxid"", and is distinct from superoxide. Additionally,
Li5O3 is stable at pressures above 70 GPa and can be represented as a hybrid

stellar evolution. Here we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20 Li-rich
giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey, which includes the first nine
Li-rich giant stars known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants
have near-solar metallicities, and stellar parameters consistent with being
before the luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing
models proposed to explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only
operate at later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an
effort to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of
the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase. We note
that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed destruction of
hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich giant stars, and
suggests Li-rich stars should be found early on the giant branch and occur more
frequently with increasing metallicity. A comprehensive review of all known
Li-rich giant stars reveals that this scenario is consistent with the data.
However more evolved or metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant
planets, implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative
explanation, likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.

the model of Fermi sphere - Brillouin zone interactions. Stability of post-fcc
structures for Li can be supported by Hume-Rothery arguments when new Brillouin
zone plains appear close to the Fermi level producing pseudogaps near the Fermi
level and decreasing the crystal energy. The filling of Brillouin-Jones zones
by electron states for a given structure defines the physical properties as
optical reflectivity, electrical resistivity and superconductivity. To
understand complexity of structural and physical properties of Li above 60 GPa
is necessary to assume the valence electrons band overlap with the upper core
electrons and increase the valence electron count under compression.

chemical abundances for 27 elements by either line equivalent widths or
synthetic spectrum analyses. Results: HD 16771 is a Li-rich
(log(n(Li))=+2.67+/-0.10 dex) intermediate mass giant star (M=2.4+/-0.1 Msun)
with age=0.76+/-0.13 Gyr and located at the red giant clump. Kinematics and
chemical compositions are consistent with HD 16771 being a member of the
Galactic thin disk population. The non-detection of 6Li(< 3%), a low carbon
isotopic ratio (12C/13C=12+/-2), and the slow rotation (vsini=2.8 km/s) all
suggest that lithium might have been synthesized in this star. On the contrary,
HD 16771 with a mass of 2.4 Msun has no chance of encountering luminosity

of a merger or mass transfer. We would expect a binary fraction of ~50% or

structure to a hybrid-electrolyte Li-air battery, where a lithium metal anode
in nonaqueous electrolyte is separated from aqueous bromine catholytes by a
lithium-ion conducting ceramic plate. The cell with a flat graphite electrode
can discharge at a peak power density around 9mW cm-2 and in principle could

occurring in low-mass stars, we test non-standard models, which were calibrated
using the Sun, with observations of three open clusters of different ages, the
Hyades, NGC 752, and M67. We collected all available data, and for the open
cluster NGC 752, we redetermine the equivalent widths and the lithium
abundances. Two sets of evolutionary models were computed, one grid of only
standard models with microscopic diffusion and one grid with rotation-induced
mixing, at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.13, 0.0, and 0.01 dex, respectively, using
the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code. We compare observations with models in a
color-magnitude diagram for each cluster to infer a cluster age and a stellar
mass for each cluster member. Then, for each cluster we analyze the lithium
abundance of each star as a function of mass. The data for the open clusters
Hyades, NGC 752, and M67, are compatible with lithium abundance being a
function of both age and mass for stars in these clusters. Our models with
meridional circulation qualitatively reproduce the general trend of lithium
abundance evolution as a function of stellar mass in all three clusters. This
study points out the importance of mass dependence in the evolution of lithium
abundance as a function of age. Comparison between models with and without
rotation-induced mixing shows that the inclusion of meridional circulation is
essential to account for lithium depletion in low-mass stars. However, our
results suggest that other mechanisms should be included to explain the Li-dip
and the lithium dispersion in low-mass stars.

shows that the vertical detachment energy (VDE) of these anions exceeds to that
of halogen, and therefore they behave as superhalogen anions. Consequently, it
might be possible to design new electrolytic salts using other superhalogen
anions. We have explored this possibility using Li-salts of various
superhalogen anions such as BO2-, AlH4-, TiH5- and VH6- as well as hyperhalogen
anions, BH4-y(BH4)y-(y = 1 to 4). Our density functional calculations show that
Li-salts of these complex anions possess similar characteristics as those of
electrolytic salts in LIBs. Note that they all are halogen free and hence,
non-toxic and safer than LiBF4, LiPF6 etc. In particular, LiB4H13 and LiB5H16
are two potential candidates for electrolytic salt due to their smaller
Li-dissociation energy ({\Delta}E) than those of LiBF4, LiPF6 etc. We have also
noticed that {\Delta}E of LiBH4-y(BH4)y varies inversely with the VDE of
BH4-y(BH4)y- anions, which increases with the increase in y. These findings may
guide experimentalists and future researchers to design and synthesize more
efficient and environment friendly electrolytic salts for LIBs.

source at CERN allows to perform (n, charged particles) experiments on
short-lived highly radioactive targets. This paper describes a detection
apparatus and the experimental procedure for the determination of the
cross-section of the 7Be(n,{\alpha}) reaction, which represents one of the
focal points toward the solution of the cosmological Lithium abundance problem,
and whose only measurement, at thermal energy, dates back to 1963. The
apparently unsurmountable experimental difficulties stemming from the huge 7Be
{\gamma}-activity, along with the lack of a suitable neutron beam facility, had
so far prevented further measurements. The detection system is subject to
considerable radiation damage, but is capable of disentangling the rare
reaction signals from the very high background. This newly developed setup
could likely be useful also to study other challenging reactions requiring the
detectors to be installed directly in the neutron beam.

this context integrated waveguide sources represent a powerful resource for the
generation of quantum states of light due to their high brightness and
stability. However, the confinement of the light in a single spatial mode
limits the realization of multi-channel sources. Due to this challenge one of
the most adopted sources in quantum information processes, i.e. a source which
generates spectrally indistinguishable polarization entangled photons in two
different spatial modes, has not yet been realized in a fully integrated
platform. Here we overcome this limitation by suitably engineering two
periodically poled waveguides and an integrated polarization splitter in
lithium niobate. This source produces polarization entangled states with
fidelity of F = 0.973(3) and a test of Bell's inequality results in a violation
larger than 14 standard deviations. It can work both in pulsed and continuous
wave regime. This device represents a new step toward the implementation of
fully integrated circuits for quantum information applications.

properties of young stellar and substellar objects and to directly image
planets thanks to their proximity ($<$200 pc) and age ($\approx$5-150 Myr).
However, many previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter,
more active members ($\approx$1 M$_\odot$) owing to photometric survey
sensitivities limiting the detections of lower mass objects. We search the
field of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to
identify wide or extremely wide (1000-100,000 au in physical separation)
companions. We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry ($J$, $H$, $K$) with
proper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the
field of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy
from the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic
observations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary
information allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. We identified 84
targets (45: 0.2-1.3 M$_\odot$, 17: 0.08-0.2 M$_\odot$, 22: $<$0.08 M$_\odot$)
in our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis
in previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to
further assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission,
UV excess, H$_\alpha$, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities,
and CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based
on the consistency of these properties. Once confirmed, the targets identified
in this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of
the young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new
sample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars.

particularly when Li is paired with energetic conversion cathodes such as
sulfur, oxygen/air, and carbon dioxide. Practical LMBs in any of these designs
remain elusive due to multiple stubborn problems, including parasitic reactions
of Li metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable/dendritic electrodeposition at
the anode during cell recharge, and chemical reaction of dissolved cathode
conversion products with the Li anode. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
formed between lithium metal and liquid electrolytes plays a critical role in
all of these processes. We report on the chemistry and interfacial properties
of artificial SEI films created by in-situ reaction of a strong Lewis Acid AlI3
additive, Li metal, and aprotic liquid electrolytes. We find that these SEI
films impart exceptional interfacial stability to a Li metal anode. We further
show that the improvements come from at least three processes: (i) in-situ

fast rotators are Li-rich compared to slow ones. This correlation is similar
to, albeit of lower amplitude than, the Li-rotation connection previously
reported for K dwarfs in the 125 Myr-old Pleiades cluster. We investigate
whether the non-standard pre-main sequence models developed so far to explain
the Pleiades results, which are based on episodic accretion, pre-main sequence
core-envelope decoupling, and/or radius inflation due to enhanced magnetic
activity, can account for an early development of the Li-rotation connection.
While radius inflation appears to be the most promising possibility, each of
these models has issues. We therefore also discuss external causes that might
operate during the first few Myr of pre-main sequence evolution, such as planet
engulfment and/or steady disk accretion, as possible candidates for the common
origin for Li-excess and fast rotation in young low-mass pre-main sequence
stars. The emergence of a connection between lithium content and rotation rate
at such an early age as 5~Myr suggests a complex link between accretion
processes, early angular momentum evolution, and possibly planet formation,
which likely impacts early stellar evolution and still is to be fully
deciphered.

typically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)
stars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age
discrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young
stars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of
the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median
age of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for
a subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown
for ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical
mass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface
magnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and
are predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the
HR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are
weakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose
structures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this
region is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective
envelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total
stellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models
appears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than
predictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic
inhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of
low-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in
young stellar populations.

  experimental and a numerical study with a Streaming Source Spatial Filtering
  (SSSF) method","  When an acoustic wave travels in a lossy medium such as a liquid, it
progressively transfers its pseudo-momentum to the fluid, which results in a
steady acoustic streaming. Remarkably, the phenomenon involves a balance
between sound attenuation and shear, such that viscosity vanishes in the final
expression of the velocity field. For this reason, the effect of viscosity has
long been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments. Here, we show
experimentally that the viscosity plays a major role in cavities such as the
streaming induced by surface acoustic waves in sessile droplets. We develop a
numerical model based on the spatial filtering of the streaming source term to
compute the induced flow motion with dramatically reduced computational
requirements. We evidence that acoustic fields in droplets are a superposition
of a chaotic field and a few powerful caustics. It appears that the caustics
drive the flow, which allows a qualitative prediction of the flow structure.
Finally, we reduce the problem to two dimensionless numbers related to the
surface and bulk waves attenuation and simulate hemispherical sessile droplets
resting on a lithium niobate substrate for a range of parameters. Even in such
a baseline configuration, we observe at least four distinct flow regimes. For
each of them, we establish a correlation of the average streaming speed in the
droplet, which is increasingly dependent on the bulk wave attenuation as the
viscosity increases. These correlations extend our results to a wide range of
fluids and actuation frequencies.

contradiction with expectations from stellar evolutionary theory. A possible
explanation for these atypical giants is the engulfment of a Li-rich planet or
brown dwarf by the star. In this work, we model the evolution of Li abundance
in canonical red giants including the accretion of a sub-stellar mass
companion. We consider a wide range of stellar and companion masses, Li
abundances, stellar metallicities, and planetary orbital periods. Based on our
calculations, companions with masses lower than 15 M_J dissolve in the
convective envelope and can induce Li enrichment in regimes where extra mixing
does not operate. Our models indicate that the accretion of a substellar
companion can explain abundances up to A(Li)~2.2, setting an upper limit for
Li-rich giants formed by this mechanism. Giants with higher abundances need
another mechanism to be explained. For reasonable planetary distributions, we
predict the Li abundance distribution of low-mass giants undergoing planet
engulfment, finding that between 1% to 3% of them should have A(Li)>1.5. We
show that depending on the stellar mass range, this traditional definition of
Li-rich giants is misleading, as isolated massive stars would be considered
anomalous while giants engulfing a companion would be set aside, flagged as
normal. We explore the detectability of companion engulfment, finding that
planets with masses higher than ~7 M_J produce a distinct signature, and that
descendants of stars originating in the Li-dip and low luminosity red giants
are ideal tests of this channel.

studies suggest that the innermost SEI layer on lithium metal surfaces should
be a thin layer of Li(2)O -- the only thermodynamically and kinetically stable

$M_{\odot}$ and $0.0875\pm0.0010$ $M_{\odot}$ and a parallactic distance of
$17.249\pm0.013$ pc. We also derive component luminosities that are consistent
with the system being coeval at an age of $80.8\pm2.5$ Myr, according to BHAC15
evolutionary models. The presence of lithium is consistent with model
predictions, marking the first time the theoretical lithium depletion boundary
has been tested with ultracool dwarfs of known mass. However, we find that the
average evolutionary model-derived effective temperature ($2950\pm5$ K) is 180
K hotter than we derive from a spectral type$-$$T_{\rm eff}$ relation based on
BT-Settl models ($2770\pm100$ K). We suggest that the dominant source of this
discrepancy is model radii being too small by $\approx$13%. In a test that
mimics the typical application of evolutionary models by observers, we derive
masses on the H-R diagram using the luminosity and BT-Settl temperature. The
estimated masses are $46^{+16}_{-19}$% (2.0$\sigma$) lower than we measure
dynamically and would imply that this is a system of $\approx$50 $M_{\rm Jup}$
brown dwarfs, highlighting the large systematic errors possible when inferring
masses from the H-R diagram. This is first time masses have been measured for
ultracool ($\geq$M6) dwarfs displaying spectral signatures of low gravity.
Based on features in the infrared, LSPM J1314+1320AB appears higher gravity
than typical Pleiades and AB Dor members, opposite the expectation given its
younger age. The components of LSPM J1314+1320AB are now the nearest, lowest

thermonuclear reaction rates now includes the associated rate uncertainties
that are used in astrophysical models to i) estimate final uncertainties on
nucleosynthesis yields and ii) identify those reactions that require further
experimental investigation. Sometimes direct cross section measurements are
possible, but more generally the use of indirect methods is compulsory in view
of the very low cross sections. Non-thermal processes are often overlooked but
are also important for nuclear astrophysics, e.g. in gamma-ray emission from
solar flares or in the interaction of cosmic rays with matter, and also
motivate laboratory experiments. Finally, we show that beyond the historical
motivations of nuclear astrophysics, understanding i) the energy sources that
drive stellar evolution and ii) the origin of the elements can also be used to
give new insights into physics beyond the standard model.

  Substitutions on Lithium Ion Conduction in LLZO Garnet","  Molecular dynamics calculations are carried out on pure, Al-substituted, and
In-substituted LLZO. The calculations show that the tendency of Al to occupy
the 24d sites in LLZO lithium ion conductors is hypothesized here to negatively
impact ionic conductivity. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of In-LLZO,
in which the In resides at the 48g sites, is predicted to be an order of
magnitude higher than Al-LLZO. Consideration of the simple tetrahedral topology
of the lithium ion conduction network suggests that the increased conductivity
arises because the 48g site sits at a bridge in the lithium ion conduction
network. An immobile ion residing in this location blocks fewer lithium
conduction pathways than an ion, such as Al, that preferentially occupies the
24d site located at a node within the network. In addition, the electronic
structure calculations presented here indicate no large difference in the
stabilities of tetragonal and cubic phases for the aluminum-substituted and
indium-substituted compounds. In both cases, the cubic phase is more stable
than the tetragonal phase. This indicates that it should be possible to make a
cubic In-LLZO phase with significant conductivity enhancement over the cubic
Al-LLZO phase.

of lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence.
However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of
angular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and
stellar data, in the sense that they overestimate internal differential
rotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly
differentially rotating at young ages, but approach solid body rotation during
their lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an
additional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for
explaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for
mixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a $\sim$20 Myr timescale
is required to explain the evolution of the mean solar-mass rotation pattern
along the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate
description of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling
produces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little
mixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr,
in agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances, we
argue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence
decreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss implications of this finding
for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic
fields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility
of intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters, using M67 as
an example.

from initial 20.4 GeV), with an energy transfer efficiencies from leading to

H2O + LinA3B2O12 = LiOH + HnA3B2O12. Most of the compositions are stable

the reaction of lithium hydroxide with CO2 to make lithium carbonate. The
calculated hydration resistance scales with the Pauling bond valence on the

good overall correlation of hydration stability with lithium stoichiometry (n):
hydration resistance increases in the order Li8-garnet < Li7-garnet <
Li6-garnet < Li5-garnet < Li3-garnet. Only Li3A3B2O12 garnets have proton

can systematically attain chemical accuracy with only a few tens of degrees of

computation of the electron density (and subsequently, ground state properties)
from the discretized Hamiltonian in an efficient and scalable manner. We show
in this work how Chebyshev polynomial filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) can
be used to address this issue and push the envelope in large-scale materials
simulations in a discontinuous Galerkin framework. We describe how the subspace
filtering steps can be performed in an efficient and scalable manner using a

microfibers, each with a diameter of 1\,$\mu$m, is proposed, where the neutron
absorption location is reconstructed from the observed charged particle
products that result from neutron absorption. To suppress the cross talk of the
scintillation light, each scintillating fiber is surrounded by air-filled glass
capillaries with the same diameter as the fiber. This pattern is repeated to
form a bulk microfiber detector. On one end, the surface of the detector is
painted with a thin optical reflector to increase the light collection
efficiency at the other end. Then the scintillation light emitted by any
neutron interaction is transmitted to one end, magnified, and recorded by an
intensified CCD camera. A simulation based on the Geant4 toolkit was developed
to model this detector. All the relevant physics processes including neutron
interaction, scintillation, and optical boundary behaviors are si\-mulated.
This simulation was first validated through measurements of neutron response
from lithium glass cylinders. With good expected light collection, an algorithm
based upon the features inherent to alpha and triton particle tracks is
proposed to reconstruct the neutron reaction position in the glass fiber array.
Given a 1\,$\mu$m fiber diameter and 0.1\,mm detector thickness, the neutron
spatial resolution is expected to reach $\sigma\sim 1\, \mu$m with a Gaussian
fit in each lateral dimension. The detection efficiency was estimated to be
3.7\% for a glass fiber assembly with thickness of 0.1\,mm. When the detector
thickness increases from 0.1\,mm to 1\,mm, the position resolution is not
expected to vary much, while the detection efficiency is expected to increase
by about a factor of ten.

battery performance, the electrode failure mechanisms are still unknown. Here,
we reveal the fundamental fracture mechanisms of single-crystal silicon
electrodes over extended lithiation/delithiation cycles, using electrochemical
testing, microstructure characterization, fracture mechanics, and finite
element analysis. Anisotropic lithium invasion causes crack initiation
perpendicular to the electrode surface, followed by growth through the
electrode thickness. The low fracture energy of the lithiated/unlithiated
silicon interface provides a weak microstructural path for crack deflection,
accounting for the crack patterns and delamination observed after repeated
cycling. Based on this physical understanding, we demonstrate how electrolyte
additives can heal electrode cracks and provide strategies to enhance the
fracture resistance in future LIBs from surface chemical, electrochemical, and
material science perspectives.

metal (Li) anode. However, its application in secondary batteries has been
inhibited because of uncontrollable dendrite growth during cycling. Mechanical
suppression of dendrite growth through solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) or
through robust separators has shown the most potential for alleviating this
problem. Studies of the mechanical behavior of Li at any length scale and
temperature are virtually non-existent because of its extreme reactivity, which
renders sample preparation, transfer, microstructure characterization and
mechanical testing prohibitively challenging. We conduct nano-mechanical
experiments in an in-situ Scanning Electron Microscope and show that
micron-sized Li attains extremely high strengths of 105 MPa at room temperature
and of 35MPa at 90$^\circ$C. We demonstrate that single crystalline Li exhibits
a power-law size-effect at the micron- and sub-micron length scales, with the
strengthening exponent of -0.68 at room temperature and of -1.00 at
90$^\circ$C. We also report the elastic and shear moduli as a function of
crystallographic orientation gleaned from experiments and first principles
calculations, which show a high level of anisotropy up to the melting point,
where the elastic and shear moduli vary by a factor of ~4 between the stiffest
and most compliant orientations. The emergence of such high strengths in
small-scale Li and sensitivity of this metal's stiffness to crystallographic
orientation help explain why the existing methods of dendrite suppression have
been mainly unsuccessful and have significant implications for practical design
of future-generation batteries.

  problem","  The possibility that the so-called ""lithium problem"", i.e. the disagreement
between the theoretical abundance predicted for primordial $^7$Li assuming
standard nucleosynthesis and the value inferred from astrophysical
measurements, can be solved through a non-thermal BBN mechanism has been
investigated by several authors. In particular, it has been shown that the
decay of a MeV-mass particle, like, e.g., a sterile neutrino, decaying after
BBN not only solves the lithium problem, but also satisfies cosmological and
laboratory bounds, making such a scenario worth to be investigated in further
detail. In this paper, we constrain the parameters of the model with the
combination of current data, including Planck 2015 measurements of temperature
and polarization anisotropies of the CMB, FIRAS limits on spectral distortions,
astrophysical measurements of primordial abundances and laboratory constraints.
We find that a sterile neutrino with mass $M_S=4.35_{-0.17}^{+0.13}\,MeV$ (at
$95\%$ c.l.), a decay time $\tau_S=1.8_{-1.3}^{+2.5}\cdot 10^5\,s$ (at $95\%$
c.l.) and an initial density $\bar{n}_S/\bar{n}_{cmb}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+3.5}\cdot
10^{-4}$ (at $95\%$ c.l.) in units of the number density of CMB photons,
perfectly accounts for the difference between predicted and observed $^7$Li
primordial abundance. This model also predicts an increase of the effective
number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of CMB decoupling $\Delta
N_{eff}^{cmb}\equiv N_{eff}^{cmb}-3.046=0.34_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$ at $95\%$ c.l..
The required abundance of sterile neutrinos is incompatible with the standard
thermal history of the Universe, but could be realized in a low reheating
temperature scenario. We provide forecasts for future experiments finding that
the combination of measurements from the COrE+ and PIXIE missions will allow to
significantly reduce the permitted region for the sterile lifetime and density.

  rotating red giants?","  Context. Fast rotating red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch
have surface velocities that cannot be explained by single star evolution.
  Aims. We check whether tides between a star and a planet followed by planet
engulfment can indeed accelerate the surface rotation of red giants for a
sufficient long time in order to produce these fast rotating red giants.
  Methods. Using rotating stellar models, accounting for the redistribution of
the angular momentum inside the star by different transport mechanisms, for the
exchanges of angular momentum between the planet orbit and the star before the
engulfment and for the deposition of angular momentum inside the star at the
engulfment, we study how the surface rotation velocity at the stellar surface
evolves.
  Results. We show that the surface velocities reached at the end of the
orbital decay due to tidal forces and planet engulfment can be similar to
values observed for fast rotating red giants. This surface velocity then
decreases when the star evolves along the red giant branch but at a
sufficiently slow pace for allowing stars to be detected with such a high
velocity. More quantitatively, star-planet interaction can produce a rapid
acceleration of the surface of the star, above values equal to 8 km s$^{-1}$,
for periods lasting up to more than 30% the red giant branch phase. The changes
of the surface carbon isotopic ratios produced by the dilution of the planetary
material into the convective envelope is quite modest. Much more important
might be the increase of the lithium abundance due to this effect. However
lithium may be affected by many different, still uncertain, processes.
  Conclusions. The acceleration of the stellar surface to rotation velocities
above limits that depend on the surface gravity does appear at the moment as
the clearest signature of a star-planet interaction.[abridged]

chiral state. By analyzing the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices and
generalizing using the $D_{2h}$ point group of all the harmonic honeycomb
lattices, we show that the superconducting state often belongs to the trivial
irreducible representation. This state has nodal lines at low to intermediate
doping, which is possible because the full lattice symmetry allows sign changes
between different sets of bonds. We also find time-reversal symmetry broken
states, which are either fully gapped or feature nodal points, in certain parts
of the phase diagram. Finally, we draw a comparison between the states
classified in terms of the $D_{2h}$ symmetries and those observed on the
$D_{6h}$ honeycomb lattice.

promising method for high-voltage cathode stabilization in Li-ion batteries.
However, there is still substantial uncertainty about how these films function,
specifically with regard to important coating design principles such as lithium
solubility and transport through the films. This study uses Density Functional
Theory to examine the diffusivity of interstitial lithium in crystalline
{\alpha}-$AlF_3$, {\alpha}-$Al_2O_3$, m-$ZrO_2$, c-MgO, and {\alpha}-quartz
$SiO_2$, which provide benchmark cases for further understanding of insulator
coatings in general. In addition, we propose an Ohmic electrolyte model to
predict resistivities and overpotential contributions under battery operating
conditions. For the crystalline materials considered we predict that Li+
diffuses quite slowly, with a migration barrier larger than 0.9 eV in all
crystalline materials except {\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, which is predicted to
have a migration barrier of 0.276 eV along <001>. These results suggest that
the stable crystalline forms of these insulator materials, except for oriented
{\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, are not practical for conformal cathode coatings.
Amorphous $Al_2O_3$ and $AlF_3$ have higher Li+ diffusivities than their
crystalline counterparts. Our predicted amorphous $Al_2O_3$ resistivity (1789
M{\Omega}m) is near the top of the range of fitted resistivities extracted from
previous experiments on nominal $Al_2O_3$ coatings (7.8 to 913 M{\Omega}m)
while our predicted amorphous $AlF_3$ resistivity (114 M{\Omega}m) is close to
the middle of the range. These comparisons support our framework for modeling
and understanding the impact on overpotential of conformal coatings in terms of
their fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties, and support that these
materials can provide practical conformal coatings in their amorphous form.

  Fluoride Lithium-Ion Battery Conversion Electrodes","  Metal fluoride and oxides can store multiple lithium-ions through conversion
chemistry to enable high energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, their
practical applications have been hindered by an unusually large voltage
hysteresis between charge and discharge voltage-profiles and the consequent low
energy efficiency (< 80%). The physical origins of such hysteresis are rarely
studied and poorly understood. Here we employ in situ X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, and galvanostatic intermittent
titration technique (GITT) to first correlate the voltage profile of iron
fluoride ($FeF_3$), a representative conversion electrode material, with
evolution and spatial distribution of intermediate phases in the electrode. The
results reveal that, contrary to conventional belief, the phase evolution in
the electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge. However, the spatial
evolution of the electrochemically active phases, which is controlled by
reaction kinetics, is different. We further propose that the voltage hysteresis
in the $FeF_3$ electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic
voltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of
electrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore,
the large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and
optimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve
the energy efficiency of lithium-ion batteries based on conversion chemistry.

using \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) crystal structure
searching methods. Thorough searches were performed for 29 stoichiometries
ranging from Li$_{12}$C to LiC$_{12}$ at 0 GPa as well as 40 GPa. Based on
formation enthalpies from optimized van der Waals density functional
calculations, three thermodynamically stable phases (Li$_4$C$_3$, Li$_2$C$_2$

BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional employed accurately captures a range
of interactions including vdW, covalent and ionic interactions. We incorporate
phonon contributions at finite temperatures and configurational entropy to get
high accuracy in free energy and potentials. We utilize the built-in error
estimation capabilities of the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional and to
develop a methodological framework for determining the uncertainty associated
with DFT calculated phase diagrams and intercalation potentials. The framework
also determines the confidence of each predicted stable phase. The confidence

of a Li depletion - rotation connection among the beta Pictoris members at an
age of about 24 Myr, and to use such correlation either to confirm or to
improve the age estimate based on the Lithium Depletion Boundary (LDB)
modeling. We have photometrically monitored all the known members of the beta
Pictoris association with at least one Lithium equivalent width (Li EW)
measurement from the literature. We measured the rotation periods of 30 members
for the first time and retrieved from the literature the rotation periods for
other 36 members, building a catalogue of 66 members with measured rotation
period and Li EW. We find that in the 0.3 < M < 0.8 Msun range, there is a
strong correlation between rotation and Li EW. For higher mass stars, no
significant correlation is found. For very low mass stars in the Li depletion
onset, at about 0.1 Msun, data are too few to infer a significant correlation.
The observed Li EWs are compared with those predicted by the Dartmouth stellar
evolutionary models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields. After
decorrelating the Li EW from the rotation period, we find that the hot side of
the LDB is fitted well by Li EW values corresponding to an age of 25$\pm$3 Myr
in good agreement with independent estimates from the literature.

these differences?
  We approach these questions by analysing and modelling circadian plant data,
where the levels of expression of a luciferase reporter gene were measured at
regular intervals over a number of days after exposure to different
concentrations of lithium.
  A key aspect of circadian data analysis is to determine whether a time series
(derived from experimental data) is `rhythmic' and, if so, to determine the
underlying period. However, our dataset displays nonstationary traits such as
changes in amplitude, gradual changes in period and phase-shifts.
  In this paper, we develop clustering methods using a wavelet transform.
Wavelets are chosen as they are ideally suited to identifying discriminant
local time and scale features. Furthermore, we propose treating the observed
time series as realisations of locally stationary wavelet processes. This
allows us to define and estimate the evolutionary wavelet spectrum. We can then
compare, in a quantitative way, using a functional principal components
analysis, the time-frequency patterns of the time series. Our approach uses a
clustering algorithm to group the data according to their time-frequency
patterns. We demonstrate the advantages of our methodology over alternative

lithium $^{7}{\rm Li}$ problem, which is a $5\sigma$ mismatch between the
theoretical prediction for the $^{7}{\rm Li}$ from big bang nucleosynthesis and
the value that we observe locally today at $z=0$. The void model can also
resolve the tension between the number of massive clusters derived from the

the CMB anisotropies, and the CMB weak lensing anomaly observed in the Planck

  Test of the Helium Flash Mechanism","  The temperature distribution of field Li-rich red giants suggests the
presence of a population of Li-rich red clump (RC) stars. One proposed
explanation for this population is that all stars with masses near 2 $M_\odot$
experience a short-lived phase of Li-richness at the onset of core He-burning.
Many of these stars have low 12C/13C, a signature of deep mixing that is
presumably associated with the Li regeneration. To test this purported
mechanism of Li enrichment, we measured abundances in 38 RC stars and 6 red
giant branch (RGB) stars in four open clusters selected to have RC masses near
2 $M_\odot$. We find six Li-rich stars (A(Li) > 1.50 dex) of which only two may
be RC stars. None of the RC stars have Li exceeding the levels observed in the
RGB stars, but given the brevity of the suggested Li-rich phase and the modest
sample size, it is probable that stars with larger Li-enrichments were missed
simply by chance. However, we find very few stars in our sample with low
12C/13C. Such low 12C/13C, seen in many field Li-rich stars, should persist
even after lithium has returned to normal low levels. Thus, if Li synthesis
during the He flash occurs, it is a rare, but potentially long-lived occurrence
rather than a short-lived phase for all stars. We estimate a conservative upper
limit of the fraction of stars going through a Li-rich phase to be <47\%, based
on stars that have low 12C/13C for their observed A(Li).

exclude that the observed lithium overabundance is partially an observational
effect due to enhanced activity, due to a large coverage by stellar spots
induced by high rotation rates. Since a bona fide lithium enhancement is
present in young, fast rotators, both activity and rotation should play a role
in the lithium problem.

in modern astrophysics. Indeed, lithium is, on the one hand, easily destroyed
in stellar interiors, and, on the other hand, produced at some specific stellar
evolutionary stages that are still not well constrained. The goal of this paper
is to investigate the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to
put constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in particular
in both the thin and thick discs. Thanks to high-resolution spectra from the
ESO archive and high quality atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a
massive and homogeneous catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived
with an automatic method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton
algorithm. We validated these lithium abundances with literature values,
including those of the Gaia benchmark stars. In terms of lithium galactic
evolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance increases with
metallicity by 1 dex from [M/H]=-1 dex to +0.0 dex. Moreover, we find that this
lithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5 dex at super-solar metalllicity.
Based on a chemical separation, we also observed that the stellar lithium
content in the thick disc increases rather slightly with metallicity, while the
thin disc shows a steeper increase. The lithium abundance distribution of
alpha-rich, metal-rich stars has a peak at A(Li)~3 dex. We conclude that the
thick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical enrichment, showing lithium
abundances rather close to the Spite plateau while the thin disc stars clearly
show an increasing lithium chemical enrichment with the metallicity, probably
thanks to the contribution of low-mass stars.

phase within lithium-ion batteries that occur during cell assembly and usage. A
two-dimensional poroviscoelastic model for the mechanical behavior of porous
electrodes is formulated and posed on a geometry corresponding to a thin
rectangular electrode, with a regular square array of microscopic circular
electrode particles, stuck to a rigid base formed by the current collector.
Deformation is forced both by (i) electrolyte absorption driven binder
swelling, and; (ii) cyclic growth and shrinkage of electrode particles as the
battery is charged and discharged. The governing equations are upscaled in
order to obtain macroscopic effective-medium equations. A solution to these
equations is obtained, in the asymptotic limit that the height of the
rectangular electrode is much smaller than its width, that shows the
macroscopic deformation is one-dimensional. The confinement of macroscopic
deformations to one dimension is used to obtain boundary conditions on the
microscopic problem for the deformations in a 'unit cell' centered on a single
electrode particle. The resulting microscale problem is solved using numerical
(finite element) techniques. The two different forcing mechanisms are found to
cause distinctly different patterns of deformation within the microstructure.
Swelling of the binder induces stresses that tend to lead to binder
delamination from the electrode particle surfaces in a direction parallel to
the current collector, whilst cycling causes stresses that tend to lead to
delamination orthogonal to that caused by swelling. The differences between the
cycling-induced damage in both: (i) anodes and cathodes, and; (ii) fast and
slow cycling are discussed. Finally, the model predictions are compared to
microscopy images of nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathodes and a qualitative
agreement is found.

early accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a
previous study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results
strengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young

predictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle
competition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central
stellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion
of fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a

  Circumstellar Disks","  We present the results of a search for new circumstellar disks around
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types >K5 that are confirmed or
candidate members of nearby young moving groups. Our search input sample was
drawn from the BANYAN surveys of Malo et al. and Gagn\'e et al. Two-Micron
All-Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data were used to detect
near- to mid-infrared excesses that would reveal the presence of circumstellar
disks. A total of 13 targets with convincing excesses were identified: four are
new and nine were already known in the literature. The new candidates are 2MASS
J05010082$-$4337102 (M4.5), J08561384$-$1342242 (M8$\,\gamma$),
J12474428$-$3816464 (M9$\,\gamma$) and J02265658$-$5327032 (L0$\,\delta$), and
are candidate members of the TW Hya ($\sim10\pm 3\,$Myr), Columba ($\sim
42^{+6}_{-4}\,$Myr) and Tucana-Horologium ($\sim 45\pm 4\,$Myr) associations,
with masses of $120$ and $13-18\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. The M8$-$L0 objects in
Columba and Tucana-Horologium are potentially among the first substellar disk
systems aged $\sim 40\,$Myr. Estimates of the new candidates' mean disk
temperatures and fractional luminosities are in the ranges $\sim 135-520\,$K
and $0.021-0.15$, respectively. New optical spectroscopy of J0501$-$4337
reveals strong H$\alpha$ emission, possibly indicating ongoing accretion,
provides a detection of lithium absorption and a radial velocity measurement
that is consistent with a membership to Columba. We also present a
near-infrared spectrum of J0226$-$5327 that reveals Paschen $\beta$ emission
and shows signs of low surface gravity, consistent with accretion from a disk
and a young age.

  Temperature","  In ballistic transport, heat carriers such as phonons travel through the
solid without any scattering or interaction. Therefore, there is no temperature
gradient in the solid, which seems to transport the heat without getting heated
itself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either
temperatures below ~10 K, or physical size below ~100 nm, where the mean free
path of the carrier is larger than the solid itself. In this letter, we show
evidence of ballistic transport at room temperature in lithium niobate wafers
in the in-plane and cross-plane directions under both steady state and high
frequency heating that are monitored using both infrared and resistance
thermometry. We report phonon mean free path in lithium niobate around 425
microns, which is about 50 times higher than the largest phonon mean free path
in the literature at room temperature. Above this length-scale, temperature
gradient gradually emerges and the material shows completely diffusive, bulk
transport at about 4 mm length. Our observations will impact phonon-based
electronics such as thermal transistor, thermal logic gate and memory currently
impossible at room temperature. If 1 micron electron mean free path in graphene
gives the highest-mobility, the 425 microns mean free path of phonons in this
research may realize phononics without any need for nanoscale size or
ultra-cold temperatures.

JET lithium beam emission spectroscopy system, measuring Li I line radiation
using 26 channels with ~1 cm spatial resolution and 10~20 ms temporal
resolution. The density profile is modelled using a Gaussian process prior, and
the uncertainty of the density profile is calculated by a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) scheme. From the spectra measured by the transmission grating
spectrometer, the Li line intensities are extracted, and modelled as a function
of the plasma density by a multi-state model which describes the relevant
processes between neutral lithium beam atoms and plasma particles. The spectral
model fully takes into account interference filter and instrument effects, that
are separately estimated, again using Gaussian processes. The line intensities
are inferred based on a spectral model consistent with the measured spectra
within their uncertainties, which includes photon statistics and electronic
noise. Our newly developed method to infer JET edge electron density profiles
has the following advantages in comparison to the conventional method: i)
providing full posterior distributions of edge density profiles, including
their associated uncertainties, ii) the available radial range for density
profiles is increased to the full observation range (~26 cm), iii) an
assumption of monotonic electron density profile is not necessary, iv) the
absolute calibration factor of the diagnostic system is automatically estimated
overcoming the limitation of the conventional technique and allowing us to
infer the electron density profiles for all pulses without preprocessing the

  Rotation and Lithium Depletion","  Precise measurements of eclipsing binary parameters and statistical studies
of young clusters have suggested that some magnetically active low-mass dwarfs
possess radii inflated by $\sim$5-15% relative to theoretical expectations. If
true, this effect should be pronounced in young open clusters, due to the rapid
rotation and strong magnetic activity of their most extreme members. We explore
this possibility by determining empirical radii for 83 members of the nearby
Pleiades open cluster, using spectral energy distribution fitting to establish
$\mathcal{F}_{bol}$ with a typical accuracy of $\approx$3\% together with color
and spectro-photometric indices to determine $T_{\rm eff}$. We find several
Pleiades members with radii inflated above radius-$T_{\rm eff}$ models from
state-of-the-art calculations, and apparent dispersions in radii for the
K-dwarfs of the cluster. Moreover, we demonstrate that this putative radius
inflation correlates strongly with rotation rate, consistent with inflation of
young stars by magnetic activity and/or starspots. We argue that this signal is
not a consequence of starspot-induced color anomalies, binarity, or depth
effects in the cluster, employing Gaia DR1 distances as a check. Finally, we
consider the lithium abundances of these stars, demonstrating a triple
correlation between rotation rate, radius inflation, and enhanced lithium
abundance. Our result---already significant to $\sim$99.99%
confidence---provides strong support for a magnetic origin of the inflated
radii and lithium dispersion observed in young, low-mass stars.

having superflares possess common properties. It relates, firstly, to stars
with activity saturation. We consider the X-ray data for G, K, and M stars
separately, and show that transition from a saturation mode to solar-type

G2, K4 and M3 spectral types, respectively. We discuss bimodal distribution of
a number of G and K main-sequence stars versus an axial rotation and location
of superflare stars with respect to other Kepler stars. We conclude that
superflare G and K stars are mainly fast rotating young objects, but some of
them belong to stars with solar-type activity. At the same time, we found a
group of G stars with high Li content $(\log A(Li) = 1.5 - 3)$, but being
slower rotators with rotation periods > 10 days, which are characterized by low
chromospheric activity. This agrees with a large spread in Li abundances in
superflare stars. A mechanism leading to this effect is discussed.

the pattern of lithium depletion seen in the cluster of young, low-mass stars
surrounding $\gamma^2$ Velorum. The age of 7.5+/-1 Myr inferred from the CMD is
much younger than that implied by the strong Li depletion seen in the cluster
M-dwarfs and the Li depletion occurs at much redder colours than predicted. The
epoch at which a star of a given mass depletes its Li and the surface
temperature of that star are both dependent on its radius. We demonstrate that
if the low-mass stars have radii ~10 per cent larger at a given mass and age,
then both the CMD and Li depletion pattern of the Gamma Vel cluster are
explained at a common age of 18-21 Myr. This radius inflation could be produced
by some combination of magnetic suppression of convection and extensive cool
starspots. Models that incorporate radius inflation suggest that PMS stars
similar to those in the Gamma Vel cluster, in the range 0.2<M/Msun<0.7, are at
least a factor of two older and ~7 per cent cooler than previously thought and
that their masses are much larger (by >30 per cent) than inferred from

  Trumpler 20","  The Gaia-ESO survey recently reported on a large sample of lithium (Li)
abundance determinations for evolved stars in the rich open cluster Trumpler
20. They argue for a scenario where virtually all stars experience post main
sequence mixing and Li is preserved in only two objects. We present an
alternate explanation, where Li is normal in the vast majority of cluster stars
and anomalously high in these two cases. We demonstrate that the Li upper
limits in the red giants can be explained with a combination of main sequence
depletion and standard dredge-up, and that they are close to the detected
levels in other systems of similar age. In our framework, the two detected
giants are anomalously Li-rich, and we propose that both could have been
produced by the engulfment of a substellar mass companion of 16(+6-10) M_J.
This would imply that ~5% of 1.8 solar mass stars in this system, and by
extension elsewhere, should have substellar mass companions of high mass that
could be engulfed at some point in their lifetimes. We discuss future tests
that could confirm or refute this scenario.

low-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud, which was at the level of
the expected primordial value. Part of the observed lithium in any environment
has primordial origin, but there is always some post-BBN (Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis) contamination, since lithium can also be produced in
cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Using the fact that
processes involving cosmic rays produce lithium, but also gamma rays through
neutral pion decay, we use the Small Magellanic Cloud gamma-ray observations by
Fermi-LAT to make predictions on the amount of lithium in this galaxy that was
produced by galactic cosmic rays accelerated in supernova remnants. By
including both fusion processes, as well as spallation of heavier nuclei, we
find that galactic cosmic rays could produce a very small amount of lithium. In
the case of 6Li isotope (which should only be produced by cosmic rays) we can
only explain 0.16% of the measured abundance. If these cosmic rays are indeed
responsible for such small lithium production, observed abundances could be the
result of some other sources, which are discussed in the paper.

to the Sun and studying the characteristics of their surface magnetic activity
is a very promising way to understand the solar variability and its associated
dynamo process. However, the identification of solar-analog stars depends on
the accuracy of the estimated stellar parameters. Thanks to the photometric
CoROT and Kepler space missions, the addition of asteroseismic data was proven
to provide the most accurate fundamental properties that can be derived from
stellar modeling today. Here, we present our latest results on the
solar-stellar connection by studying 18 solar analogs that we identified among
the Kepler seismic sample (Salabert et al., 2016a). We measured their magnetic
activity properties using the observations collected by the Kepler satellite
and the ground-based, high-resolution HERMES spectrograph. The photospheric
(Sph) and chromospheric (S) magnetic activity proxies of these seismic solar
analogs are compared in relation to the solar activity. We show that the
activity of the Sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs,
within the maximum-to-minimum temporal variations of the 11-year solar activity
cycle. Furthermore, we report on the discovery of temporal variability in the
acoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC10644253 with a
modulation of about 1.5 years, which agrees with the derived photospheric
activity Sph (Salabert et al, 2016b). It could be the signature of the
short-period modulation, or quasi-biennal oscillation, of its magnetic activity
as observed in the Sun and in the 1-Gyr-old solar analog HD30495. In addition,
the lithium abundance and the chromospheric activity estimated from HERMES
confirms that KIC10644253 is a young and more active star than the Sun.

that measures the mechanical response resulting from the application of a
highly localized electric field. Though mechanical response is normally due to
piezoelectricity, other physical phenomena, especially electrostatic
interaction, can contribute to the signal read. We address this problematic
through the use of longer ultra-stiff probes providing state of the art
sensitivity, with the lowest electrostatic interaction and avoiding working in
high frequency regime. In order to find this solution we develop a theoretical
description addressing the effects of electrostatic contributions in the total
cantilever vibration and its quantification for different setups. The theory is
subsequently tested in a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal, a
sample with well-defined 0deg and 180deg domains, using different commercial
available conductive tips. We employ the theoretical description to compare the
electrostatic contribution effects into the total phase recorded. Through
experimental data our description is corroborated for each of the tested
commercially available probes. We propose that a larger probe length can be a
solution to avoid electrostatic forces, so the cantilever-sample electrostatic
interaction is reduced. For hard oxide samples we propose an ultra-stiff
cantilever which avoids the use of high frequency voltage but still diminishing
electrostatic forces. Our proposed commercially available solution have great
implications into avoiding artifacts while studying soft biological samples,
multiferroic oxides, and thin film ferroelectric materials and it opens a new
window into tip engineering.

(partially oxidized, stacked sheets of graphene) have shown great potential in
water desalination and purification, gas and ion separation, biosensors, proton
conductors, lithium-based batteries and super-capacitors. Unlike carbon
nanotube (CNT) membranes, in which the nanotube pores have fixed sizes, the
pores of GO membranes - the interlayer spacing between GO sheets - are of
variable size. This presents a challenge for using GO membranes for filtration.
Despite the great efforts to tune and fix the interlayer spacing, it remains
difficult both to reduce the interlayer spacing sufficiently to exclude small
ions while keeping this separation constant against the tendency of GO
membranes to swell when immersed in aqueous solution, which greatly affects the
applications of GO membranes. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that highly
efficient and selective ion rejection by GO membranes can be readily achieved
by controlling the interlayer spacing of GO membranes using cations (K+, Na+,
Ca2+, Li+ and Mg2+) themselves. The interspacing can be controlled with
precision as small as 1 A, and GO membranes controlled by one kind of cation
can exclude other cations with a larger hydrated volume, which can only be
accommodated with a larger interlayer spacing. First-principles calculations
reveal that the strong noncovalent cation-pi interactions between hydrated
cations in solution and aromatic ring structures in GO are the cause of this
unexpected behavior. These findings open up new avenues for using GO membranes
for water desalination and purification, lithium-based batteries and
super-capacitors, molecular sieves for separating ions or molecules, and many
other applications.

dots, color centres or atoms are fundamentally different in their frequencies

different systems, to date no interface exists that provides both an efficient
bandwidth compression and a substantial frequency translation at the same time.
Here, we demonstrate an engineered sum-frequency-conversion process in Lithium
Niobate that achieves both goals. We convert pure photons at telecom
wavelengths to the visible range while compressing the bandwidth by a factor of
7.47 under preservation of non-classical photon-number statistics. We achieve
internal conversion efficiencies of 75.5%, significantly outperforming spectral
filtering for bandwidth compression. Our system thus makes the connection

the presence of a planet with a minimum mass of 26 Earth masses around the
solar twin HIP 68468. The planet is a super-Neptune, but unlike the distant
Neptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major
axis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus. The data also suggest the presence
of a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 2.9 Earth masses at 0.03 AU; if the
planet is confirmed, it will be the fifth least massive radial velocity planet
discovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin. Both
isochrones (5.9 Gyr) and the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 Gyr) indicate an age
of about 6 billion years. The star is enhanced in refractory elements when
compared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after
corrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance
of 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age
of HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log(R'HK) (-5.05) and
low jitter. Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the
enhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. [Conclusions]. The
super-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and
therefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration
that could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus
the abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing
evidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the
existence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain
the nature of the planetary system around this unique star.

particular for solar-like oscillators in this context. Binary stars are
fascinating objects. Because they were formed together, binary systems provide
a set of two stars with very well constrained parameters. Those can be used to
study properties and physical processes, such as the stellar rotation, dynamics
and rotational mixing of elements and allows us to learn from the differences
we find between the two components. In this work, we discussed a detailed study
of the binary system KIC9163796, discovered through Kepler photometry. The
ground-based follow-up spectroscopy showed that this system is a double-lined
spectroscopic binary, with a mass ratio close to unity. However, the
fundamental parameters of the components of this system as well as their
lithium abundances differ substantially. Kepler photometry of this system
allows to perform a detailed seismic analysis as well as to derive the orbital
period and the surface rotation rate of the primary component of the system.
Indications of the seismic signature of the secondary are found. The differing
parameters are best explained with both components located in the early and the
late phase of the first dredge up at the bottom of the red-giant branch.
Observed lithium abundances in both components are in good agreement with
prediction of stellar models including rotational mixing. By combining
observations and theory, a comprehensive picture of the system can be drawn.

hydrogen when above 500 GPa. Nonetheless, the variation of the melting curve at
higher pressures is virtually uncharted. Here we report that using ab initio

  inferred from their colours and chemical abundances","  Blue metal-poor stars (BMPs) are main sequence stars that appear bluer and
more luminous than normal turnoff stars. They were originally singled out by
using B-V and U-B colour cuts. Early studies found that a larger fraction of
field BMP stars were binaries compared to normal halo stars. Thus, BMP stars
are ideal field blue straggler candidates for investigating internal stellar
evolution processes and binary interaction. In particular, the presence or
depletion in lithium in their spectra is a powerful indicator as to their
origin. They are either old, halo blue stragglers experiencing internal mixing
processes or mass transfer (Li-depletion), or intermediate-age, single stars of
possibly extragalactic origin (2.2dex halo plateau Li). However, we note that
internal mixing processes can lead to an increased level of Li. Hence, this
study combines photometry and spectroscopy to unveil the origin of various BMP
stars. We first show how to separate binaries from young blue stars using
photometry, metallicity, and lithium. Using a sample of 80 BMP stars (T>6300K),
we find that 97% of the BMP binaries have V-Ks_0 < 1.08$\pm0.03$, while BMP
stars that are not binaries lie above this cut in 2/3 of the cases. This cut
can help classify stars which lack radial velocities from follow-up
observations. We trace the origin of two BMP stars from the photometric sample
by conducting a full chemical analysis using new high-resolution and high SN
spectra. Based on their radial velocities, Li, alpha, and s- and r-process
abundances we show that BPS CS22874-042 is a single star
(A(Li)$=2.38\pm0.10$dex) while with A(Li)$=2.23\pm0.07$dex CD-48 2445 is a
binary, contrary to earlier findings. Our analysis emphasises that field blue
stragglers can be segregated from single metal-poor stars, using V-Ks colours
with a fraction of single stars polluting the binary sample, but not vice
versa.(Abridged)

ordinary solar-analog stars. We measured Ca II 8542 and H$\alpha$ lines, which
are good indicators of the chromospheric activity. The intensity of these lines
indicates that all the target stars have large starspots. We also measured
$v\sin i$ (projected rotational velocity) and Lithium abundance for the target
stars. Li abundance is a key to understanding the evolution of the stellar
convection zone, which reflects the stellar age, mass and rotational history.
We confirmed that many of the target stars rapidly rotate and have high Li
abundance, compared with the Sun, as suggested by many previous studies. There
are, however, also some target stars that rotate slowly ($v\sin i$=2$\sim$3 km
s$^{-1}$) and have low Li abundance like the Sun. These results support that
old and slowly rotating stars similar to the Sun could have high activity level
and large starspots. This is consistent with the results of our previous
studies of solar-type superflare stars. In the future, it is important to
conduct long-term monitoring observations of these active solar-analog stars in
order to investigate detailed properties of large starspots from the viewpoint
of stellar dynamo theory.

opportunity to study the preceding and following evolutionary phases of our
host star. The unprecedented quality of photometric data collected by the
\Kepler NASA mission allows us to characterise solar-like stars through
asteroseismology and study diagnostics of stellar evolution, such as variation
of magnetic activity, rotation and the surface lithium abundance. In this
project, presented in a series of papers by Salabert et al. (2016a,b) and Beck
et al (2016a,b), we investigate the link between stellar activity, rotation,
lithium abundance and oscillations in a group of 18 solar-analogue stars
through space photometry, obtained with the NASA Kepler space telescope and
from currently 50+ hours of ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy with the
Hermes instrument. In these proceedings, we first discuss the selection of the
stars in the sample, observations and calibrations and then summarise the main
results of the project. By investigating the chromospheric and photospheric
activity of the solar analogues in this sample, it was shown that for a large
fraction of these stars the measured activity levels are compatible to levels
of the 11-year solar activity cycle 23. A clear correlation between the lithium
abundance and surface rotation was found for rotation periods shorter than the
solar value. Comparing the lithium abundance measured in the solar analogues to
evolutionary models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolutionary Code (TGEC), we found
that the solar models calibrated to the Sun also correctly describe the set of
solar/stellar analogs showing that they share the same internal mixing physics.
Finally, the star KIC 3241581 and KIC 10644353 are discussed in more detail.

degradation are of utmost necessity to streamline further developments. We
demonstrate that electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) can be used to quickly map SEI
components and quantify LixSi alloys from single experiments, with resolutions
down to 5 nm. Exploiting the low-loss part of the EEL spectrum allowed us to
circumvent the degradation phenomena that have so far crippled the application
of this technique on such beam-sensitive compounds. Our results provide
unprecedented insight into silicon aging mechanisms in full cell configuration.
We observe the morphology of the SEI to be extremely heterogeneous at the
particle scale but with clear chemical evolutions with extended cycling coming
from both SEI accumulation and a transition from lithium-rich carbonate-like
compounds to lithium-poor ones. Thanks to the retrieval of several results from
a single dataset, we were able to correlate local discrepancies in lithiation
to the initial crystallinity of silicon as well as to the local SEI chemistry
and morphology. This study emphasizes how initial heterogeneities in the
percolating electronic network and the porosity affect SiNPs aggregates along
cycling. These findings pinpoint the crucial role of an optimized formulation
in silicon-based thick electrodes.

different stages of its life time is considered to explain its low photospheric
value in comparison with that of the solar system meteorites. Lithium is
intensively and transiently burned in the early stages of evolution (pre-main
sequence, pMS) when the radiative core arises, and then the Li abundance only
slowly decreases during the main sequence (MS). We study the rates of lithium
burning during these two stages. In a model of the Sun, computed ignoring pMS
and without extra-convective mixing (overshooting) at the base of the
convection zone, the lithium abundance does not decrease significantly during
the MS life time of 4.6 Gyr. Analysis of helioseismic inversions together with
post-model computations of chemical composition indicates the presence of the
overshooting region and restricts its thickness. It is estimated to be
approximately half of the local pressure scale height 0.5Hp) which corresponds
to 3.8 % of the solar radius. Introducing this extra region does not noticeably
deplete lithium during the MS stage. In contrast, at the pMS stage, an
overshooting region with a value of approximately 0.18Hp is enough to produce
the observed lithium depletion. If we conclude that the dominant lithium
burning takes place during the pMS stage, the dispersion of the lithium
abundance in solar twins is explained by different physical conditions,
primarily during the early stage of evolution before the MS.

their structural features and reproduces coordination environment of ions,
resulting in an adhesive energy of 116 meV/{\AA}2 between graphite and lithium

5800\,\mathrm{K}$ and $[{\rm Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.5$) exhibit almost constant
lithium abundances, irrespective of metallicity or effective temperature, and
thus form the so-called Spite plateau. This was originally interpreted as
arising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent
observations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars;
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-4.0$) have significantly lower lithium abundances than that
of the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection
between the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A
straightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP
stars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we
have determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars
with metallicities $[{\rm Fe/H}]\sim -3.0$, where there are numerous
carbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered.
Our 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium
abundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests
that carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related.
Instead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental
cause to depleted lithium in UMP stars.

and cooperativity of electron-phonon-interaction distortions in
LiCo$_y$Mn$_{2-y}$O$_{4}$ is investigated. The first order
cooperative-normal-mode transition, detected through coefficient of thermal
expansion, is found to disappear at a critical doping ($y \sim 0.16$);
interestingly, for $y \gtrsim 0.16$ the resistivity does not change much with
doping and the electrochemical capacity becomes constant over repeated cycling.
The critical doping $y \sim 0.16$ results in breakdown of the network of
cooperative/coherent normal-mode distortions; this leads to vanishing of the
first-order transition, establishment of hopping channels with lower
resistance, and enhancing lithiation and delithiation of the battery, thereby
minimizing electrochemical capacity fading.

7Li(n,g)8Li-activation and subsequent fast beta-decay (0.84 s) of the 8Li
isotope with emission of hard antineutrinos with energy up to 13 MeV. In the
discussed scheme the nuclear reactor is used as an intensive neutron source for
(n,g)-activation. The created 8Li isotopes are transported in the channels with
a high speed to the remote neutrino detector and removed back for the next
activation. The antineutrino source operates in the continuous cycle in the
closed loop. Use of 8Li hard antineutrino spectrum in the source scheme ensures
significantly harder total antineutrino spectrum (compare to the reactor one)
in the position of the detector. The analyses of errors of the total
antineutrino spectrum (from reactor antineutrinos plus from lithium ones)
confirmed that owing to the lithium the errors of the total antineutrino
spectrum can be diminished in two times and more. The results of errors
analysis is important for sterile neutrino search and the possible
configuration of the experiment is discussed.

matching, which is defined by waveguide design. Lithium niobate allows
compensating for the phase mismatch using periodically poled waveguides,

evolution: 1) Old stars in the galactic halo, which have a lithium abundance
log e(Li)=2.2 (the ""lithium plateau"") that appears to be 0.5 dex lower than the
primordial abundance predicted by cosmological models. 2) Young stars in the

evolution of the galaxy are discussed. 3) Evolving FGK dwarfs in the galactic
disk, which have lower log e(Li) for lower effective temperature Teff and mass
M. The ""lithium dip"" near Teff~6600 K in the distribution of log e(Li) with
respect to Teff in old clusters is discussed. 4) FGK giants and supergiants, of

materials that underwent different mechanical and thermal treatments. Several
complimentary methods are used to assess the coherence lifetimes for these
highly scattering media. Direct intensity or heterodyne detection of two-pulse
photon echo techniques was employed for samples with longer coherence lifetimes
and larger signal strengths, while time-delayed optical free induction decays
were found to work well for shorter coherence lifetimes and weaker signal
strengths. Spectral hole burning techniques were also used to characterize
samples with very rapid dephasing processes. The results on powders are
compared to the properties of a bulk crystal, with observed differences
explained by the random orientation of the particles in the powders combined
with new decoherence mechanisms introduced by the powder fabrication. Modeling
of the coherence decay shows that paramagnetic materials such as
Er$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_3$ that have highly anisotropic interactions with an applied
magnetic field can still exhibit long coherence lifetimes and relatively simple
decay shapes even for a powder of randomly oriented particles. We find that
coherence properties degrade rapidly from mechanical treatment when grinding
powders from bulk samples, leading to the appearance of amorphous-like behavior
and a broadening of up to three orders of magnitude for the homogeneous
linewidth even when low-energy grinding methods are employed. Annealing at high

linewidths reduced to less than 10 kHz, approaching the bulk crystal linewidth
of 3 kHz under the same experimental conditions.

and the salt migrates towards hot or cold regions depending on the average
temperature of the solution. This effect has been interpreted using the heat of
transport, which provides a route to rationalize thermophoretic phenomena.
Early theories provide estimates of the heat of transport at infinite dilution.
These values are used to interpret thermodiffusion (Soret) and thermoelectric
(Seebeck) effects. However, accessing heats of transport of individual ions at
finite concentration remains an outstanding question both theoretically and
experimentally. Here we discuss a computational approach to calculate heats of
transport of aqueous solutions at finite concentrations, and apply our method
to study lithium chloride solutions at concentrations $>0.5$~M. The heats of
transport are significantly different for Li$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions, unlike what
is expected at infinite dilution. We find theoretical evidence for the
existence of minima in the Soret coefficient of LiCl, where the magnitude of
the heat of transport is maximized. The Seebeck coefficient obtained from the
ionic heats of transport varies significantly with temperature and
concentration. We identify thermodynamic conditions leading to a maximization
of the thermoelectric response of aqueous solutions.

""stages,"" driven by competing intra-layer and inter-layer forces. While these
structures are often well characterized in equilibrium, their effects on
intercalation kinetics and transport far from equilibrium are typically
neglected or approximated by empirical solid solution models. Here, we
formulate a general phase-field model with thermodynamically consistent
reaction kinetics and cooperative transport to capture the dynamics of
intercalation in layered materials. As an important case for Li-ion batteries,
we model single particles of lithium intercalated graphite as having a periodic
two-layer structure with three stable phases, corresponding to zero, one, or
two layers full of lithium. The electrochemical intercalation reaction is
described by a generalized Butler-Volmer equation with thermodynamic factors to
account for the flexible structure of the graphene planes. The model naturally
captures the ""voltage staircase"" discharge curves as a result of staging
dynamics with internal ""checkerboard"" domains, which cannot be described by
solid-solution models based on Fickian diffusion. On the other hand, the
two-layer model is computationally expensive and excludes low-density stable
phases with longer-range periodicity, so we also present a reduced model for
graphite, which captures the high-density stages while fitting the low-density
voltage profile as an effective solid solution. The two models illustrate the
general tradeoff between the explicit modeling of periodic layers or lattices

the relation between surface rotation, A(Li) and age in a sample of seismic
solar-analogue (SA) stars and study their possible binary nature. We select a
sample of 18 SA observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis.
Their seismic properties and surface rotation are well constrained from
previous studies. About 53 hours of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained
to derive fundamental parameters and A(Li). These values were combined and
confronted with seismic masses, radii and ages, as well as surface rotation
periods. We identify a total of 6 binary systems. A well-defined relation
between A(Li) and rotation was obtained. With models constrained by the
characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we
identify a sequence of three SA with similar mass (~1.1Mo) and stellar ages
ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of ~7% for the mass
uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the
predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the
Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal
mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We present A(Li) for
a consistent spectroscopic survey of SA with a mass of 1.00+/-0.15Mo, and
characterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on
Kepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and P_rot supports the
gyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun. The consensus between
measured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated onto the Sun's
chemical properties suggests that these targets share the same internal

a star like the Sun.

Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach
begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM to
determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover
that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six independent
parameters. We then examine the structural identifiability by considering
whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that
the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions
have a known non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode
kinetics are lumped into a single charge transfer resistance parameter. We then
demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured
frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
data, and show additionally that the parametrised model provides good
predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error
of 20 mV between model and experiment over a 10 minute dynamic discharge.

For this purpose we complement existing PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar
Evolution Code) models, which are based on the solar partition, with
alpha-enhanced partitions. We collect detailed measurements on the metal
mixture and He abundance for the two populations of 47Tuc from literature, and
calculate stellar tracks and isochrones with these chemical compositions
([alpha/Fe]~0.4 and 0.2). By fitting precise CMD with HST data from low main
sequence till horizontal branch, we calibrate free parameters that are
important for the evolution of low mass stars. The new calibration and
alpha-enhanced mixtures are applied to other metallicities. The new models
reproduce the RGB bump observations much better than previous models.
  PARSEC is able to predict any chemical pattern in stellar evolution. Li is
one of the most intriguing ones. Li abundance derived in POP II dwarfs is about
three times lower than the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predicts. This
disagreement is referred as the cosmological lithium problem. We reconsider the
stellar Li evolution from pre-main sequence to the end of main sequence by
introducing the effects of convective overshooting and residual accretion.
$^7$Li could be significantly depleted by convective overshooting in the
pre-main sequence and then partially restored in the stellar atmosphere by a
tail of matter accretion which could be regulated by EUV photo-evaporation. By
considering the conventional nuclear burning and microscopic diffusion along
the main sequence, we reproduce the Spite plateau for $m_0=0.62-0.80M_{\odot}$
stars, and the Li declining branch for lower mass dwarfs, with a wide range of
metallicities (Z=0.00001 to Z=0.0005), starting from the primordial abundance

on timescales of tens of picoseconds are possible with superconducting photon
detectors and picosecond measurements have been performed using streak cameras,
there are no commercial single photon sensitive devices with femtosecond

live-view of the measurement. We demonstrate the measurement technique and
combine it with spectral measurements using a dispersive fiber time-of-flight

A(Li) in both the Hyades (90) and Praesepe (110). For each star, high-precision
UBVRI photometry was used to determine a ten color-based Teff and then to test
for photometric peculiarities indicated by a large sigma-Teff (> 75 K). The

that have low sigma-Teff and are also photometrically consistent with the

previously observed and the two clusters' A(Li) are indistinguishable. This
suggests that clusters of consistent age and metallicity may have consistent
Li-depletion trends across a broad range of Teff; no additional major
parameters are required, at least for these two clusters. We propose that the

candidate for scalable fabrication processes and to achieve higher carrier
injection with respect to most commonly used ETLs. In this work we
experimentally study the effects of different graphene-based ETLs in sensitized

  Population","  The Taurus-Auriga association and its associated molecular cloud are a
benchmark population for studies of star and planet formation. The census of
Taurus-Auriga has been assembled over seven decades and has inherited the
biases, incompleteness, and systematic uncertainties of the input studies. The
notably unusual shape of the inferred IMF and the existence of several isolated
disk-bearing stars suggest that additional (likely disk-free) members might
remain to be discovered. We therefore have begun a global reassessment of the
membership of Taurus-Auriga that exploits new data and better definitions of
youth and kinematic membership. As a first step, we reconsider the membership
of all disk-free candidate members from the literature with spectral type
$\ge$F0, $3^h50^m<\alpha<5^h40^m$, and $14^{\circ}<\delta<34^{\circ}$. We
combine data from the literature with Keck/HIRES and UH88/SNIFS spectra to test
the membership of these candidates using HR diagram positions, proper motions,
RVs, H$\alpha$, lithium, and surface gravity. We find 218 confirmed or likely
Taurus members, 160 confirmed or likely interlopers, and only 18 that still
lack sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. A significant fraction of
these stars (81/218=37%) are not included in the most recent canonical member
lists. Intriguingly, there are few additional members in the immediate vicinity
of the molecular clouds, preserving the IMFs that have been deemed anomalous in
past work. Many of the likely Taurus members are distributed broadly across the
search area. When combined with known disk hosts, our updated census reveals
two regimes: a high-density population with a high disk fraction (indicative of
youth) that broadly traces the molecular clouds, and a low-density population
with low disk fraction (hence likely older) that most likely represents
previous generations of star formation.

dynamic optimal power flow between battery energy storage systems distributed

formulation, based on a linear d-q reference frame voltage-current model and
linearised power flow approximations. This allows the optimal power flows to be
solved as a convex optimisation problem, for which fast and robust solvers
exist. The proposed method does not assume real and reactive power flows are
decoupled, allowing line losses, voltage constraints and converter current
constraints to be addressed. In addition, non-linear variations in the charge
and discharge efficiencies of lithium ion batteries are analysed and included
in the control strategy. Real-time digital simulations were carried out for an
islanded microgrid based on the IEEE 13 bus prototypical feeder, with
distributed battery energy storage systems and intermittent photovoltaic
generation. It is shown that the proposed control strategy approaches the
performance of a strategy based on non-convex optimisation, while reducing the
required computation time by a factor of 1000, making it suitable for a
real-time model predictive control implementation.

  efficient and power-resistant nonlinear converters","  Despite its attractive features, Congruent-melted Lithium Niobate (CLN)
suffers from Photo-Refractive Damage (PRD). This light-induced refractive-index
change hampers the use of CLN when high-power densities are in play, a typical
regime in integrated optics. The resistance to PRD can be largely improved by
doping the lithium-niobate substrates with magnesium oxide. However, the
fabrication of waveguides on MgO-doped substrates is not as effective as for
CLN: either the resistance to PRD is strongly reduced by the waveguide
fabrication process (as it happens in Ti-indiffused waveguides) or the
nonlinear conversion efficiency is lowered (as it occurs in annealed-proton
exchange). Here we fabricate, for the first time, waveguides starting from
MgO-doped substrates using the Soft-Proton Exchange (SPE) technique and we show
that this third way represents a promising alternative. We demonstrate that SPE
allows to produce refractive-index profiles almost identical to those produced
on CLN without reducing the nonlinearity in the substrate. We also prove that
the SPE does not affect substantially the resistance to PRD. Since the
fabrication recipe is identical between CLN and MgO-doped substrates, we
believe that SPE might outperform standard techniques to fabricate robust and
efficient waveguides for high-intensity-beam confinement.

the effect of plasmon interaction across the vacuum separating periodic images
of the doped graphene layers, consisting of transparent boundary conditions in
the direction perpendicular to the layers; this represents a significant

The resulting plasmon modes are due to local field efffects and the non-local

different allowed values of the spontaneous polarization, the so-called
domains. These walls - neutral or charged - can be created, displaced, deleted,
and recreated again in ferroelectric materials. [1-3] Owing to the recent
progress in the studies of ferroelectrics, they are expected to be functional
active elements of the future nano-electronics.[1,4,5] Metallic-like
conductivity of charged domain walls (CDWs) in insulating ferroelectrics,
predicted in 1970s6 and detected recently,[7-10] is especially attractive for
applications. This important effect is still in its infancy. The electric
currents are small, the access to the conductivity is hampered by contact
barriers, and stability is low because of sophisticated domain structures
and/or proximity of the Curie point. Here, we report on giant and accessible
persistent CDW conductivity in lithium niobate (LN) crystals (LiNbO3) - a vital
material for photonics. [12] Our results are by far superior to the data known
for other materials: Increase of LN conductivity by more than 14 orders of
magnitude owing to CDWs, access to the effect via Ohmic and semi-Ohmic
contacts, and its high stability for temperatures of up to 70 {\deg}C are
demonstrated. It is made clear why this big effect was missed earlier [11,25]
in LN. Our results demonstrate that strong conductivity of CDWs is available in
simple ferroelectric materials, possessing only two allowed orientations of the
spontaneous polarization, far from the Curie point. Also, CDW functionalities
can be combined with linear and nonlinear optical phenomena. [14,15] Our
findings allow new generations of adaptive-optical elements, of electrically
controlled integrated-optical chips for quantum photonics, and of advanced
LN-semiconductor hybrid optoelectronic devices.

process utilizes the same chemistry previously demonstrated in the atomic layer
deposition of aluminum fluoride thin films, and can therefore be exploited to
remove the surface oxide from metallic aluminum and replace it with thin
fluoride layers in order to improve the performance of ultraviolet aluminum
mirrors. This ALE process is modified relative to existing methods through the
use of a chamber conditioning film of lithium fluoride, which is shown to
enhance the loss of fluorine surface species and results in conformal
layer-by-layer etching of aluminum oxide films. Etch properties were explored
over a temperature range of 225 to 300 {\deg}C with the Al2O3 etch rate
increasing from 0.8 to 1.2 {\AA} per ALE cycle at a fixed HF exposure of 60 ms
per cycle. The effective etch rate has a dependence on the total HF exposure,
but the process is shown to be scalable to large area substrates with a
post-etch uniformity of better than 2% demonstrated on 125 mm diameter wafers.

data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose
Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and
highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic
approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian non-parametric method, and hence can
model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior
information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean
functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation
model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit
correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive
capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life)
forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion
cells.

programs targeting 31 ultracool binaries with component spectral types M7-T5.
Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space
Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic
distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and
photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise
individual masses spanning 30-115 $M_{\rm Jup}$. We determine a
model-independent substellar boundary that is $\approx$70 $M_{\rm Jup}$ in mass
($\approx$L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015)
evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 $M_{\rm
Jup}$ at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the
substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only
the Saumon & Marley (2008) ""hybrid"" models accounting for cloud clearing match
our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective
temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct
determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and
30-70 $M_{\rm Jup}$. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population
synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star
formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We
discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured
masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully
considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are
significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries,
possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks.
Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

cosmological ""constant"" $\Lambda$ fluctuates between positive and negative

causal set theory, it postulates that $\Lambda$ is a stochastic function of
cosmic time that will vary from one realization of the scenario to another.
Herein, we consider two models of ""dark energy"" that exhibit these features.
Via Monte Carlo Markov chains, we explore the space of cosmological parameters

Everpresent $\Lambda$ can fit the current cosmological observations as well as
the $\Lambda$CDM model does. Furthermore, it removes observational tensions
with $\Lambda$CDM, for low redshift measurements of Hubble constant, and the
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $z\sim 2-3$.
However, we also find that Everpresent $\Lambda$ does not significantly help
with the growth of ultramassive black holes at high redshift, and the Lithium
problem in Big Bang Nuclesynthesis. Future measurements of ""dark energy"" at
high redshifts will further test the viability of Everpresent $\Lambda$ as an

helps in preventing crack formation and pulverization due to large fluctuations

NLTE spectrum synthesis, permit to derive reliable atomic and isotopic chemical
abundances from high-resolution stellar spectra. Not much is known about the
presence of the fragile 6Li isotope in evolved solar-metallicity RGB stars, not
to mention its production in magnetically active targets like HD123351. From
fits of the observed CFHT spectrum with synthetic line profiles based on 1D and
3D model atmospheres, we seek to estimate the abundance of the 6Li isotope and
to place constraints on its origin. We derive A(Li) and the 6Li/7Li isotopic
ratio by fitting different synthetic spectra to the Li-line region of a
high-resolution CFHT spectrum (R=120 000, S/R=400). The synthetic spectra are
computed with four different line lists, using in parallel 3D hydrodynamical
CO5BOLD and 1D LHD model atmospheres and treating the line formation of the
lithium components in non-LTE (NLTE). We find A(Li)=1.69+/-0.11 dex and
6Li/7Li=8.0+/-4.4 % in 3D-NLTE, using the line list of Mel\'endez et al.
(2012), updated with new atomic data for V I, which results in the best fit of
the lithium line profile of HD123351. Two other line lists lead to similar
results but with inferior fit qualities. Our 2-sigma detection of the 6Li
isotope is the result of a careful statistical analysis and the visual
inspection of each achieved fit. Since the presence of a significant amount of
6Li in the atmosphere of a cool evolved star is not expected in the framework
of standard stellar evolution theory, non-standard, external lithium production
mechanisms, possibly related to stellar activity or a recent accretion of rocky
material, need to be invoked to explain the detection of 6Li in HD123351.

influences its intercalation behavior, overall cost, structural stability, and
its impact on environment. At present, the most common type of cathode
materials, NCA , has very high cobalt concentration. Since cobalt is toxic and
expensive, the existing design of cathode materials is not cost-effective, and
environmentally benign. However, these immensely important issues have not yet
been properly addressed. Therefore, we have performed density functional theory
(DFT) calculations to investigate three types of NCA cathode materials
NCA_(Co=0.15), NCA_(Co=0.10), NCA_(Co=0.05). Our results show that even if the
cobalt concentration is significantly decreased from NCA_(Co=0.15) to
NCA_(Co=0.05), variation in intercalation potential and specific capacity is
negligible. For example, in case of 50% Li concentration, voltage drop is
~0.12V while change in specific capacity is negligible. Moreover, decrease in
cobalt concentration doesn't influence the structural stability. We have also
explored the influence of sodium doping on the electrochemical and structural
properties of these three structures. Our results provide insight into the
design of cathode materials with reduced cobalt concentration, environmentally
benign, low-cost cathode materials.

dense molecular hydrogen, as well as searching for room temperature
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. A recent high pressure
experiment reported the successful synthesis of novel insulating lithium
polyhydrides when above 130 GPa. However, the results are in sharp contrast to
previous theoretical prediction by PBE functional that around this pressure
range all lithium polyhydrides (LiHn (n = 2-8)) should be metallic. In order to
address this discrepancy, we perform unbiased structure search with first
principles calculation by including the van der Waals interaction that was
ignored in previous prediction to predict the high pressure stable structures
of LiHn (n = 2-11, 13) up to 200 GPa. We reproduce the previously predicted
structures, and further find novel compositions that adopt more stable
structures. The van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) significantly alters the
relative stability of lithium polyhydrides, and predicts that the stable
stoichiometries for the ground-state should be LiH2 and LiH9 at 130-170 GPa,
and LiH2, LiH8 and LiH10 at 180-200 GPa. Accurate electronic structure
calculation with GW approximation indicates that LiH, LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are
insulative up to at least 208 GPa, and all other lithium polyhydrides are
metallic. The calculated vibron frequencies of these insulating phases are also
in accordance with the experimental infrared (IR) data. This reconciliation
with the experimental observation suggests that LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are the
possible candidates for lithium polyhydrides synthesized in that experiment.
Our results reinstate the credibility of density functional theory in
description H-rich compounds, and demonstrate the importance of considering van
der Waals interaction in this class of materials.

adopted to evaluate the factors and their effects on VLi which include the
diameter of carbon nanotube, functional group type on the port and the number
of a given type of functional group. The statistical analysis of the
calculation results shows that: In the selected carbon nanotubes of four
different diameters, VLi will gradually rise with the increase of CNT diameter
due to lithium irons migration resistance decreasing; as the port of CNT is
successively modified to hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2) and
carboxyl (-COOH), the corresponding migration resistance of lithium ions is
enhanced resulting in the dropping of VLi; in comparison to the effect strength
of four types of functional groups on VLi, -COOH shows strongest, -NH2 and -OH
perform relatively weaker, and the effect difference between -NH2 and -OH is
very small, -H displays weakest; When the number of a given non-hydrogen
functional group on the port sequentially increases, it also shows a trend that
lithium ion migration resistance gradually increases which makes VLi decreases
in turn. The more influential the functional group, the greater the impact of
functional group number changes on VLi. The results of this paper have some

at 200$\,$GPa revealed a metallic Li$_2$BH$_6$ phase, which is
thermodynamically stable down to 100$\,$GPa. This {\em superhydride} phase,
crystallizing in a $Fm\bar{3}m$ space group, is characterized by six-fold
hydrogen-coordinated boron atoms occupying the $fcc$ sites of the unit cell.
Due to strong hydrogen-boron bonding this phase displays a critical temperature
of $\sim$ 100$\,$K between 100 and 200$\,$GPa. Our investigations confirm that
ternary compounds used in hydrogen-storage applications are a suitable choice
for observing high-$T_\text{c}$ conventional superconductivity in diamond anvil
cell experiments, and suggest a viable route to optimize the critical
temperature of high-pressure hydrides.

aluminosilicates proceeds via hopping of Li ions, the nature of the various
hoping-based mechanisms in different temperature regimes has not been fully
elucidated. The difficulties associated with investigating the conduction have
to do with the presence of grains and grain boundaries of different
orientations in these usually polycrystalline materials. Herein, we use
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the ion conduction
mechanisms in -eucryptite, which is a prototypical lithium aluminosilicate. In
the absence of significant structural transitions in grain boundaries, we have
found that there are three conduction regimes for the one-dimensional ionic
motion along the c axis channels in the grains, and determined the activation
energies for each of these temperature regimes. Activation energies computed
from molecular statics calculations of the potential energy landscape
encountered by Li ions suggest that at temperatures below 440 {\deg}C
conduction proceeds via cooperative or correlated motion, in agreement with
established literature. Between 440 {\deg}C and 500{\deg}C, the activation
barriers extracted from EIS measurements are large and consistent with those
from atomistic calculations for uncorrelated Li ion hopping. Above 500 {\deg}C
the activation barriers decrease significantly, which indicates that after the
transition to the Li-disordered phase of -eucryptite, the Li ion motion largely
regains the correlated character.

monitoring, particularly climate change, air, water and soil quality, in
disaster monitoring and in border security. The reduced cost of electronics,
sensors and actuators make it possible to deploy hundreds if not thousands of
these sensor modules. However power technology have not kept up. Current power
supply technologies such as batteries limit many applications due to their low
specific energy. Photovoltaics typically requires large bulky panels and is
dependent on varying solar insolation and therefore requires backup power
sources. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising
alternative, because they are clean, quiet and operate at high efficiency.
However challenges remain in achieving long lives due to factors such as
catalyst degradation and hydrogen storage. In this work, we devise a framework
for designing fuel cells power supplies for field sensor networks to achieve
long lives and utilize lithium hydride hydrogen storage technology that offers
high energy density of up to 5,000 Wh/kg. Using this design framework, we
identify operating conditions to maximize the life of the power supply, meet
the required power output and minimize fuel consumption. We devise a series of
controllers to achieve this capability and demonstrate it using a bench-top
experiment that operated for 5,000 hours. The laboratory experiments point
towards a pathway to design and scale these fuel cell power supplies for
various field applications. Our studies show the proposed PEM fuel cell hybrid
system fueled using lithium hydride offers at least a 3 fold reduction in mass
compared to state of the art batteries and 3-5 fold reduction in mass compared
to current fuel cell technologies.

properties and functionality as they are decisive for stability, result in
enhanced diffusion, and act as a reservoir of vacancies. Recently, lithium-rich
layered oxides have emerged among the leading candidates for the
next-generation energy storage cathode material, delivering 50 % excess
capacity over commercially used compounds. Oxygen-redox reactions are believed
to be responsible for the excess capacity, however, voltage fading has
prevented commercialization of these new materials. Despite extensive research
the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning oxygen-redox reactions and
voltage fade remain incomplete. Here, using operando three-dimensional Bragg
coherent diffractive imaging, we directly observe nucleation of a mobile
dislocation network in nanoparticles of lithium-rich layered oxide material.
Surprisingly, we find that dislocations form more readily in the lithium-rich
layered oxide material as compared with a conventional layered oxide material,
suggesting a link between the defects and the anomalously high capacity in
lithium-rich layered oxides. The formation of a network of partial dislocations
dramatically alters the local lithium environment and contributes to the
voltage fade. Based on our findings we design and demonstrate a method to
recover the original high voltage functionality. Our findings reveal that the
voltage fade in lithium-rich layered oxides is reversible and call for new
paradigms for improved design of oxygen-redox active materials.

many important applications. Scaling LN devices down to a nanoscopic scale can
dramatically enhance light-matter interaction that would enable nonlinear and
quantum photonic functionalities beyond the reach of conventional means.
However, developing LN-based nanophotonic devices turns out to be nontrivial.
Although significant efforts have been devoted in recent years, LN photonic
crystal structures developed to date exhibit fairly low quality. Here we
demonstrate LN photonic crystal nanobeam resonators with optical Q as high as
10^5, more than two orders of magnitude higher than other LN nanocavities
reported to date. The high optical quality together with tight mode confinement
leads to extremely strong nonlinear photorefractive effect, with a resonance
tuning rate of 0.64 GHz/aJ, or equivalently 84 MHz/photon, three orders of
magnitude greater than other LN resonators. In particular, we observed
intriguing quenching of photorefraction that has never been reported before.
The devices also exhibit strong optomechanical coupling with gigahertz
nanomechanical mode with a significant f*Q product of 1.47*10^12 Hz. The
demonstration of high-Q LN photonic crystal nanoresonators paves a crucial step
towards LN nanophotonics that could integrate the outstanding material
properties with versatile nanoscale device engineering for diverse intriguing

  and barium elemental abundances","  With the purpose of performing a homogeneous determination of elemental
abundances for members of the Lupus T association, we analyzed three chemical
elements: lithium, iron, and barium. The aims were: to derive the Li abundance
for ~90% of known class II stars in the Lupus I, II, III, IV clouds; to perform
chemical tagging of a region where few Fe abundance measurements have been
obtained in the past, and no determination of the Ba content has been done up
to now. We also investigated possible Ba enhancement, as this element has
become increasingly interesting in the last years following the evidence of Ba
over-abundance in young clusters, the origin of which is still unknown. Using
X-shooter@VLT, we analyzed the spectra of 89 cluster members, both class II and
III stars. We measured the strength of the Li line and derived the abundance of
this element through equivalent width measurements and curves of growth. For
six class II stars we also measured the Fe and Ba abundances using the spectral
synthesis and the code MOOG. The veiling contribution was taken into account
for all three elements. We find a dispersion in the strength of the Li line at
low Teff and identify three targets with severe Li depletion. The nuclear age
inferred for these highly Li-depleted stars is around 15 Myr, which exceeds the
isochronal one. As in other star-forming regions, no metal-rich members are
found in Lupus, giving support to a recent hypothesis that the Fe abundance
distribution of most of the nearby young regions could be the result of a
common and widespread star formation episode involving the Galactic thin disk.
We find that Ba is over-abundant by ~0.7 dex with respect to the Sun. Since
current theoretical models cannot reproduce this Ba abundance pattern, we
investigated whether this unusually large Ba content might be related to
effects due to stellar parameters, stellar activity, and accretion.

  battery electrodes using phase-field modelling","  The improvement of Li-ion battery performance requires development of models
that capture the essential physics and chemistry in Li-ion battery electrode
materials. In this paper a novel electrochemical phase-field model is presented
that captures the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithium-insertion in
TiO$_2$-anatase, a well-known and intensively studied Li-ion battery electrode
material. Previous experimental work on lithiated anatase TiO$_2$ provided all
parameters necessary for the phase-field simulations, giving the opportunity to
gain fundamental insight in the lithiation of anatase and validate this
phase-field model. The phase-field model captures the essential experimentally
observed phenomena, rationalising the impact of C-rate, particle size, surface
area, and the memory effect on the performance of anatase as a Li-ion battery
electrode. Thereby a comprehensive physical picture of the lithiation of
anatase TiO$_2$ is provided. The results of the simulations demonstrate that
the performance of anatase is limited by the formation of the poor Li-ion
diffusion in the Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of the particles. Unlike
other electrode materials, the kinetic limitations of individual anatase
particles limit the performance of full electrodes. Hence, rather than
improving the ionic and electronic network in electrodes, improving the
performance of anatase TiO$_2$ electrodes requires preventing the formation of
a blocking Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of particles. Additionally, the
qualitative agreement of the phase-field model, containing only parameters from
literature, with a broad spectrum of experiments demonstrates the capabilities
of phase-field models for understanding Li-ion electrode materials, and its
promise for guiding the design of electrodes through a thorough understanding
of material properties and their interactions.

survey for multiplicity. We try to fill that observational gap by looking for
wide resolved binaries with angular separations between 0.4 and 4.0 arcsec. We
search for companions to 331 catalogued cluster stellar members and candidates
in public K-band UKIDSS images outside the innermost 1 arcmin, which is
affected by the glare of the bright, eponymous sigma Ori multiple system, and
investigate their cluster membership with colour-magnitude diagrams and
previous knowledge of youth features. Of the 18 identified pairs, ten have very
low individual probabilities of chance alignment (< 1 %) and are considered
here as physical pairs. Four of them are new, while the other six had been
discovered previously, but never investigated homogeneously and in detail.
Projected physical separations and magnitude differences of the ten probably
bound pairs range from 180 to 1220 au, and from 0.0 to 3.4 mag in K,
respectively. Besides, we identify two cluster stars with elongated point
spread functions. We determine the minimum frequency of wide multiplicity in
the interval of projected physical separations s = 160-1600 au in sigma Orionis
at 3.0^{+1.2}_{-1.1} %. We discover a new Lindroos system, find that massive

truncates circumstellar discs and enhances X-ray emission, and ascribe a
reported lithium depletion in a young star to unresolved binarity in spectra of
moderate resolution. When accounting for all know multiples, including
spectroscopic binaries, the minimum frequency of multiplicity increases to
about 10 %, which implies that of the order of 80-100 unknown multiple systems
still await discovery in sigma Orionis.

intercalation voltage starts at 3.50 V for single-atom insertion and decreases
to 2.23 V for full lithiation, to the LiVO2 compound, which agrees well with

Mg0.5VO2 and then another plateau-like region at around 0.5 V up to Mg1VO2. The

  Monte Carlo Simulation Study","  Ionic transport in solid electrolytes can often be approximated as ions
performing a sequence of hops between distinct lattice sites. If these hops are
uncorrelated, quantitative relationships can be derived that connect
microscopic hopping rates to macroscopic transport coefficients. At non-dilute
concentrations the relationships between hopping frequency, diffusion
coefficient, and ionic conductivity deviate from the random walk case, with
this deviation quantified by single-particle and collective correlation
factors, $f$ and $f_\mathrm{I}$. These factors vary between materials, and
depend on the concentration of mobile particles, the nature of the
interactions, and the host lattice geometry. Here we study these correlation
effects for the garnet lattice using lattice-gas Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that for non-interacting particles (volume exclusion only) single-particle
correlation effects are more significant than for any previously studied
three-dimensional lattice. This is attributed to the presence of two-coordinate
lattice sites, which causes correlation effects intermediate between typical
three-dimensional and one-dimensional lattices. Including nearest-neighbour
repulsion and on-site energies produces more complex single-particle
correlations and introduces collective correlations. We predict particularly
strong correlation effects at $x_\mathrm{Li}=3$ (from site energies) and
$x_\mathrm{Li}=6$ (from nearest-neighbour repulsion). Both effects are
consequences of ordering of the mobile particles. Using these simulation data,
we consider tuning the mobile ion stoichiometry to maximise the ionic
conductivity, and show that the ""optimal"" composition is highly sensitive to
the precise nature and strength of the microscopic interactions. Finally, we
discuss the practical implications of these results in the context of lithium
garnets and other solid electrolytes.

long been used as an indicator of the grammage traversed in the journey of
cosmic ray particles throughout the Galaxy. The basic idea is that primary
particles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant
shocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally
interacting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce
secondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically
$\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of
the main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\delta}$, where $E_{k}$
is the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and
$\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The
same shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the
first place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided
being above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by
spallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get
accelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of
debate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium
taking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the
recent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron
and lithium flux. Both these sets of data seem to confirm that reacceleration
of secondary nuclei indeed plays an important role, thereby affecting the
validity of those scaling rules that are often used in cosmic ray physics.

binary system HAT-P-4, by studying abundance vs condensation temperature Tc
trends. The star HAT-P-4 hosts a planet detected by transits while its stellar
companion does not have any detected planet. We also study the Lithium content,
which could shed light on the problem of Li depletion in exoplanet host stars.
Conclusions. The exoplanet host star HAT-P-4 is found to be ~0.1 dex more metal
rich than its companion, which is one of the highest differences in metallicity
observed in similar systems. This could have important implications for
chemical tagging studies, disentangling groups of stars with a common origin.
We rule out a possible peculiar composition for each star as lambda Boo, delta
Scuti or a Blue Straggler. The star HAT-P-4 is enhanced in refractory elements
relative to volatile when compared to its stellar companion. Notably, the
Lithium abundance in HAT-P-4 is greater than in its companion by ~0.3 dex,
which is contrary to the model that explains the Lithium depletion by the
presence of planets. We propose a scenario where, at the time of planet
formation, the star HAT-P-4 locked the inner refractory material in
planetesimals and rocky planets, and formed the outer gas giant planet at a
greater distance. The refractories were then accreted onto the star, possibly
due to the migration of the giant planet. This explains the higher metallicity,
the higher Lithium content, and the negative Tc trend detected. A similar
scenario was recently proposed for the solar twin star HIP 68468, which is in
some aspects similar to HAT-P-4. We estimate a mass of at least Mrock ~ 10
Mearth locked in refractory material in order to reproduce the observed Tc
trends and metallicity.

investigated in classical molecular dynamics simulations. Various force fields
based on the 12-6 Lennard-Jones model, parametrized for non-polarizable water
solvent molecules (SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4PEw), were inspected. Twenty-nine
combinations of ion-water interaction models were examined at four different
salt concentrations. Densities, static dielectric constants and self-diffusion
coefficients were calculated. Results derived from the different force fields
scatter over a wide range of values. Neutron and X-ray weighted structure
factors were also calculated from the radial distribution functions and
compared with experimental data. It was found that the agreement between
calculated and experimental curves is rather poor for several investigated
potential models, even though some of them have previously been applied in
computer simulations. None of the investigated models yield satisfactory
results for all the tested quantities. Only two parameter sets provide
acceptable predictions for the structure of highly concentrated aqueous LiCl
solutions. Some approaches for adjusting potential parameters, such as those of
Aragones [Aragones et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 118 (2014) 7680] and Pluharova
[Pluharova et al, J. Phys. Chem. A 117 (2013) 11766], were tested as well; the
simulations presented here underline their usefulness. These refining methods
are suited to obtain more appropriate ion/water potentials.

  realistic multi-dimensional simulations","  We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of
time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at
the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by
multi-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations
performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective
boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical
analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science.
In this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a
one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from
multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose
a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of
lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from $\sim$
50 Myr to $\sim$ 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective
penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain
the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional
assumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the
convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar
rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration
of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing
a possible explanation for the long standing problem of lithium depletion in
pre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that
its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.

connections between this problem and that of color superconductivity in quantum
chromodynamics. We consider s-wave contact interactions between different
colors, and we identify superfluid phases, with five being nodal and one being
fully gapped. When our system is described in a mixed color basis, the
superfluid order parameter tensor is characterized by six independent
components with explicit momentum dependence induced by color-orbit coupling.
The nodal superfluid phases are topological in nature, and the low temperature
phase diagram of color-flip field versus interaction parameter exhibits a
pentacritical point, where all five nodal color superfluid phases converge.
These results are in sharp contrast to the case of zero color-flip and
color-orbit fields, where the system has perfect U(3) symmetry and possess a
superfluid phase that is characterized by fully gapped quasiparticle
excitations with a single complex order parameter with no momentum dependence
and by inert unpaired fermions representing a non-superfluid component.
Furthermore, we analyse the order parameter tensor in a total pseudo-spin
basis, investigate its momentum dependence in the singlet, triplet and quintet
sectors, and compare the results with the simpler case of spin-1/2 fermions in
the presence of spin-flip and spin-orbit fields. Finally, we analyse in detail
spectroscopic properties of color superfluids in the presence of color-flip and
color-orbit fields, such as the quasiparticle excitation spectrum, momentum
distribution, and density of states to help characterize all the encountered
topological quantum phases, which can be realized in fermionic isotopes of

represent an intriguing period of stellar evolution, i.e. when the convective
envelope interacts with the fast-rotating core. During these mixing episodes
freshly synthesized lithium can come up to the stellar surface along with high
angular momentum material. This high angular momentum may alter the surface
rotation pattern.
  Aims: The single rapidly rotating K-giant V1192 Ori is revisited to determine
its surface differential rotation, lithium abundance, and basic stellar
properties such as a precise rotation period. The aim is to independently
verify the antisolar differential rotation of the star and possibly find a
connection to the surface lithium abundance.
  Methods: We applied time-series Doppler imaging to a new multi-epoch data
set. Altogether we reconstructed 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data
collected with the STELLA robotic telescope between 2007--2016. We used our
inversion code iMap to reconstruct all stellar surface maps. We extracted the
differential rotation from these images by tracing systematic spot migration as
a function of stellar latitude from consecutive image cross-correlations.
  Results: The position of V1192 Ori in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
suggests that the star is in the helium core-burning phase just leaving the RGB
bump. We measure $A({\rm Li})_{\rm NLTE}=1.27$, i.e. a value close to the
anticipated transition value of 1.5 from Li-normal to Li-rich giants. Doppler
images reveal extended dark areas arranged quasi-evenly along an equatorial
belt. No cool polar spot is found during the investigated epoch. Spot
displacements clearly suggest antisolar surface differential rotation with
$\alpha=-0.11\pm0.02$ shear coefficient.
  Conclusions: The surface Li enrichment and the peculiar surface rotation
pattern may indicate a common origin.

  Battery Pack: A Distributed Kalman Filtering Approach","  Despite the ever-increasing use across different sectors, the lithium-ion
batteries (LiBs) have continually seen serious concerns over their thermal
vulnerability. The LiB operation is associated with the heat generation and
buildup effect, which manifests itself more strongly, in the form of highly
uneven thermal distribution, for a LiB pack consisting of multiple cells. If
not well monitored and managed, the heating may accelerate aging and cause
unwanted side reactions. In extreme cases, it will even cause fires and
explosions, as evidenced by a series of well-publicized incidents in recent
years. To address this threat, this paper, for the first time, seeks to
reconstruct the three-dimensional temperature field of a LiB pack in real time.
The major challenge lies in how to acquire a high-fidelity reconstruction with
constrained computation time. In this study, a three-dimensional thermal model
is established first for a LiB pack configured in series. Although spatially
resolved, this model captures spatial thermal behavior with a combination of
high integrity and low complexity. Given the model, the standard Kalman filter
is then distributed to attain temperature field estimation at substantially
reduced computational complexity. The arithmetic operation analysis and
numerical simulation illustrate that the proposed distributed estimation
achieves a comparable accuracy as the centralized approach but with much less
computation. This work can potentially contribute to the safer operation of the
LiB packs in various systems dependent on LiB-based energy storage, potentially
widening the access of this technology to a broader range of engineering areas.

  Wavelength Spacing","  Quantum correlated, highly non-degenerate photons can be used to synthesize
disparate quantum nodes and link quantum processing over incompatible
wavelengths, thereby constructing heterogeneous quantum systems for otherwise
unattainable superior performance. Existing techniques for correlated photons
have been concentrated in the visible and near-IR domains, with the photon
pairs residing within one octave. Here, we demonstrate direct generation and
detection of high-purity photon pairs at room temperature that are four octaves
apart, one at 780 nm to match the rubidium D2 line, and the other at 3950 nm
that falls in a transparent, low-scattering optical window for free space
applications. The pairs are created via spontaneous parametric downconversion
in a lithium niobate waveguide with specially designed geometry and periodic
poling. The 780 nm photons are measured with a silicon avalanche photodiode,
and the 3950 nm photons are measured with an upconversion photon detector using
a similar waveguide, which attains 34% internal conversion efficiency. Quantum
correlation measurement yields a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 54,
which indicates the strong correlation with the extremely non-degenerate photon
pairs. Our system bridges existing quantum technology to the challenging mid-IR
regime, where unprecedented applications are expected in metrology, sensing,
communications, medical diagnostics, and so on.

form factors. However, existing methods for fabricating TSSBs are limited to
planar geometries, which severely limits areal energy density when the
electrodes are kept sufficiently thin to achieve high areal power. In order to
circumvent this limitation, we report the first successful fabrication of fully
conformal, 3D full cell TSSBs formed in micromachined silicon substrates with
aspect ratios up to ~10 using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at low processing
temperatures (at or below 250C) to deposit all active battery components. The
cells utilize a prelithiated LiV$_2$O$_5$ cathode, a very thin (40 - 100 nm)
LiPON-like lithium polyphosphazene (Li$_2$PO$_2$N) solid electrolyte, and a

methods, provides an avenue for the successful realization of long-sought 3D
TSSBs which provide power performance scaling in regimes inaccessible to planar

low level of scatter in our analysis, with standard deviations as low as 0.05
dex, and mean errors as low as 0.05 dex for [X/Fe]. By expanding our
metallicity range with precise abundances from other works, we were able to
precisely constrain Galactic chemical evolution models in a wide metallicity
range ($-3.6 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le -0.4$). The agreements and discrepancies found
are key for further improvement of both models and observations. We also show
that the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for
chromium, as Cr I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen
when we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models.
While Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is
very well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower
metallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results
strongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar
parameters results in a low star-to-star scatter ($0.04$ dex) in the Li
abundances of our sample, with a mean value about $0.4$ dex lower than the
prediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation
between lithium depletion and stellar mass, but it is difficult to assess a
correlation due to the limited mass range. We find two blue straggler stars,
based on their very depleted Li abundances. One of them shows intriguing
abundance anomalies, including a possible zinc enhancement, suggesting that
zinc may have been also produced by a former AGB companion.

  the Presence of Elasticity","  We study numerically and analytically the instabilities associated with phase
separation in a solid layer on which an external material ux is imposed. The
first instability is localized within a boundary layer at the exposed free
surface by a process akin to spinodal decomposition. In the limiting static
case, when there is no material ux, the coherent spinodal decomposition is
recovered. In the present problem stability analysis of the time-dependent and
non-uniform base states as well as numerical simulations of the full governing
equations are used to establish the dependence of the wavelength and onset of
the instability on parameter settings and its transient nature as the patterns
eventually coarsen into a at moving front. The second instability is related to
the Mullins- Sekerka instability in the presence of elasticity and arises at
the moving front between the two phases when the ux is reversed. Stability
analyses of the full model and the corresponding sharp-interface model are
carried out and compared. Our results demonstrate how interface and bulk
instabilities can be analysed within the same framework which allows to
identify and distinguish each of them clearly. The relevance for a detailed
understanding of both instabilities and their interconnections in a realistic
setting are demonstrated for a system of equations modelling the
lithiation/delithiation processes within the context of Lithium ion batteries.

  State Estimation using an Electrochemical Model","  Accurate state estimation of large-scale lithium-ion battery packs is
necessary for the advanced control of batteries, which could potentially
increase their lifetime through e.g. reconfiguration. To tackle this problem,
an enhanced reduced-order electrochemical model is used here. This model allows
considering a wider operating range and thermal coupling between cells, the
latter turning out to be significant. The resulting nonlinear model is
exploited for state estimation through unscented Kalman filters (UKF). A sensor
network composed of one sensor node per battery cell is deployed. Each sensor
node is equipped with a local UKF, which uses available local measurements
together with additional information coming from neighboring sensor nodes. Such
state estimation scheme gives rise to a partition-based unscented Kalman filter
(PUKF). The method is validated on data from a detailed simulator for a battery
pack comprised of six cells, with reconfiguration capabilities. The results
show that the distributed approach outperforms the centralized one in terms of
computation time at the expense of a very low increase of mean-square
estimation error.

  direct multiple ionization by a single Auger decay or by impact of a single
  electron or photon","  Multiple electron processes occur widely in atoms, molecules, clusters, and
condensed matters when they are interacting with energetic particles or intense
laser fields. In this work, a unified and accurate theoretical formalism is
proposed on the direct multielectron processes of atoms including the multiple
Auger decay and multiple ionization by an impact of an energetic electron or a
photon based on the atomic collision theory described by a correlated many-body
Green's function. Such a practical treatment is made possible due to different
coherence features of the particles (matter waves) in the initial and final
states. We first explain how the coherence characteristics of the ejected
continuum electrons is largely destructed, by taking the electron impact direct
double ionization process as an example. This process is completely different
from the single ionization where the complete interference can be maintained.
The detailed expressions are obtained for the energy correlations among the
continuum electrons and energy resolved differential and integral cross
sections according to the separation of knock-out and shake-off mechanisms for
the electron impact direct double ionization, direct double and triple Auger
decay, and double and triple photoionization processes. The approach is applied
to investigate the electron impact double ionization processes of C$^+$, N$^+$,
and O$^+$, the direct double and triple Auger decay of the K-shell excited
states of C$^{+}$ $1s2s^22p^2$ $^2D$ and $^2P$, and the double and triple
photoionization of lithium. Comparisons with available experimental and
theoretical results show that our proposed theoretical formalism is accurate
and effective in treating the atomic multielectron processes.

batteries strongly affects their performance. Vice versa, the microstructure
can exhibit strong changes during the usage of the battery due to aging
effects. For a better understanding of these effects, mathematical analysis and
modeling has turned out to be of great help. In particular, stochastic 3D
microstructure models have proven to be a powerful and very flexible tool to
generate various kinds of particle-based structures. Recently, such models have
been proposed for the microstructure of anodes in lithium-ion energy and power
cells. In the present paper, we describe a stochastic modeling approach for the
3D microstructure of cathodes in a lithium-ion energy cell, which differs
significantly from the one observed in anodes. The model for the cathode data
enhances the ideas of the anode models, which have been developed so far. It is
calibrated using 3D tomographic image data from pristine as well as two aged
cathodes. A validation based on morphological image characteristics shows that
the model is able to realistically describe both, the microstructure of
pristine and aged cathodes. Thus, we conclude that the model is suitable to
generate virtual, but realistic microstructures of lithium-ion cathodes.

  through more accurate battery and degradation modelling","  The increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy generators opens up
opportunities for grid-connected energy storage. Batteries offer significant
flexibility but are relatively expensive at present. Battery lifetime is a key
factor in the business case, and it depends on usage, but most techno-economic
analyses do not account for this. For the first time, this paper quantifies the
annual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical
dynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery
models of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of
each is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set
(Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11\%
to 5\% is found by increasing the model accuracy. The three models are then
used within an optimal control algorithm to perform price arbitrage over one
year, including degradation. Results show that the revenue can be increased
substantially while degradation can be reduced by using more realistic models.
The estimated best case profit using a sophisticated model is a 175%
improvement compared with the simplest model. This illustrates that using a
simplistic battery model in a techno-economic assessment of grid-connected
batteries might substantially underestimate the business case and lead to
erroneous conclusions.

is one of the major science drivers of nuclear physics. A comprehensive
understanding of these systems goes beyond the traditional configuration
interactions approach formulated in the Hilbert space of localized states
(nuclear shell model) and requires an open quantum system description. The
complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM) provides such a framework as it is
capable of describing resonant and non-resonant many-body states on equal
footing.
  To make reliable predictions, quality input is needed that allows for the
full uncertainty quantification of theoretical results. In this study, we carry
out the optimization of an effective GSM (one-body and two-body) interaction in
the $psdf$ shell model space. The resulting interaction is expected to describe
nuclei with $5 \leqslant A \leqslant 12$ at the $p-sd$-shell interface.
  The optimized one-body potential reproduces nucleon-$^4$He scattering phase
shifts up to an excitation energy of 20 MeV. The two-body interaction built on
top of the optimized one-body field is adjusted to the bound and unbound
ground-state binding energies and selected excited states of the Helium,
Lithium, and Beryllium isotopes up to $A=9$. A very good agreement with
experiment was obtained for binding energies. First applications of the
optimized interaction include predictions for two-nucleon correlation densities
and excitation spectra of light nuclei with quantified uncertainties.
  The new interaction will enable comprehensive and fully quantified studies of
structure and reactions aspects of nuclei from the $psd$ region of the nuclear
chart.

are developed for using published calculations to determine the non-LTE
correction {\Delta\}NLTE to the lithium abundance log{\epsilon}(Li) derived
from the Li I 6707.8 {\AA} line. The {\Delta\}NLTE values is determined from
the following five parameters: {\Delta\}NLTE the effective temperature Teff,
the acceleration of gravity logg, the metallicity index [Fe/H], the
microturbulent velocity Vt, and the LTE Li abundance log {\epsilon}(Li). The
program is used to calculate values of {\Delta\}NLTE and the non-LTE Li

combining these results with data for 55 stars, we obtain the non-LTE values of
log {\epsilon}(Li) for 146 FGK-giants and supergiants. We confirm that, in the
spectra of most of these stars, it is only possible to estimate for them an
upper limit for the Li abundance. A large spread is confirmed in log
{\epsilon}(Li) for stars with masses M<6Msun. A comparison of these results
with model calculations of stars confirms the unique sensitivity of the lithium
abundance to the initial rotation velocity V0. We discuss the giants and
supergiants with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li) = 1.4 +- 0.3, which
could have a rotation velocity V0=0 km/s and have already undergone deep
convective mixing. Li-rich giants with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li)>2

as well as all of the ""super Li-rich"" giants, for which the standard theory is
untenable, can be explained by invoking the hypothesis of recent lithium

of our planet hosts rotate slower, f) our estimate of a lower limit of lithium
isotopic ratio is \Li $>$10 in the atmospheres of two SWP and two non-SWP
stars.
  Measurable lithium abundances were found in the atmospheres of 45 stars
located at distances of 20-170 pc from the Sun, for the other 62 stars the
upper limits of log N(Li) were computed. We found well defined dependences of
lithium abundances on \Teff, \vsini, and less pronounced for the \logg. In case
of \vsini we see two sequences of stars: with measurable lithium and with the
upper limit of log N(Li). About 10\% of our targets are known to host planets.
Only two SWP have notable lithium abundances, so we found a lower proportion of
stars with detectable Li among known planet hosts than among stars without
planets. However, given the small sample size of our planet-host sample, our
analysis does not show any statistically significant differences in the lithium
abundance between SWP and stars without known planets.

(GIFAD) was first interpreted only in terms of elastic diffraction from a
perfectly periodic rigid surface with atoms fixed at equilibrium position.
Recently, a new approach have been proposed, referred here as the quantum
binary collision model (QBCM). The QBCM takes into account both the elastic and
inelastic momentum transfer via the Lamb-Dicke probability. It suggests that
the shape of the inelastic diffraction profiles are log-normal distributions
with a variance proportional to the nuclear energy loss deposited on the
surface. For keV Neon atoms impinging the LiF surface, the predictions of the
QBCM in its analytic version are compared with numerical trajectory
simulations. Some of the assumptions such as the planar continuous form, the
possibility to neglect the role of lithium atoms and the influence of
temperature are investigated. A specific energy loss dependence $\Delta
E\propto\theta^7$ is identified in the quasi-elastic regime merging
progressively to the classical onset $\Delta E\propto\theta^3$. The ratio of
these two predictions highlight the role of quantum effects in the energy loss.

materials is a preeminent challenge, particularly in electrochemical energy
storage. Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals exemplify a diverse family of
materials that permit ions to reversibly associate with a host atomic lattice
by intercalation into interlamellar gaps. Motivated principally by the search
for high-capacity battery anodes, ion intercalation in composite materials is a
subject of intense study. Yet the precise role and ability of heterolayers to
modify intercalation reactions remains elusive. Previous studies of vdW hybrids
represented ensemble measurements at macroscopic films/powders, which do not
permit the isolation and investigation of the chemistry at individual
2-dimensional (2D) interfaces. Here, we demonstrate the intercalation of
lithium at the level of individual atomic interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers.
Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures comprised of
deterministically stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene (G) and molybdenum
dichalcogenide (MoX2; X = S, Se) layers are fabricated, enabling the direct
resolution of intermediate stages in the intercalation of discrete
heterointerfaces and the extent of charge transfer to individual layers.
Operando magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy coupled with
low-temperature quantum magneto-oscillation measurements show that the creation
of intimate vdW heterointerfaces between G and MoX2 engenders over 10-fold
accumulation of charge in MoX2 compared to MoX2/MoX2 homointerfaces, while
enforcing a more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoX2 by at
least 0.5 V. Beyond energy storage, our new combined experimental and
computational methodology to manipulate and characterize the electrochemical
behavior of layered systems opens up new pathways to control the charge density

metallicity distribution increases as we approach solar metallicity.
Meteorites, which carry information about the chemical composition of the
interstellar medium at the solar system formation time, show a lithium
abundance A(Li)~3.26 dex. This pattern reflects the Li enrichment history of
the interstellar medium during the Galaxy lifetime. After the initial Li
production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the sources of the enrichment include
AGB stars, low-mass red giants, novae, type II supernovae, and Galactic cosmic
rays. The total amount of enriched Li is sensitive to the relative contribution
of these sources. Thus different Li enrichment histories are expected in the
Galactic thick and thin disc. We investigate the main sequence stars observed
with UVES in Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 catalog and find a Li-[alpha/Fe]
anticorrelation independent of [Fe/H], Teff, and log(g). Since in stellar
evolution different {\alpha} enhancements at the same metallicity do not lead
to a measurable Li abundance change, the anticorrelation indicates that more Li
is produced during the Galactic thin disc phase than during the Galactic thick
disc phase. We also find a correlation between the abundance of Li and
s-process elements Ba and Y, and they both decrease above the solar
metallicity, which can be explained in the framework of the adopted Galactic
chemical evolution models.

exploitation of open clusters as age calibrators. We perform a homogeneous
analysis of eight open clusters using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright
members, and information from the Gaia-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster
membership probabilities for the Gaia-ESO Survey targets are derived based on
several spectroscopic tracers. The Gaia-ESO Survey also provides the cluster
chemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first
one relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while
the other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS
sources. Ages and reddening values are recovered through a Bayesian analysis
using the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of standard models. Lithium depletion
boundary (LDB) ages are also determined using literature observations and the
same models employed for the Bayesian analysis. For all but one cluster,
parallaxes derived by us agree with those presented in Gaia Collaboration et
al. (2017), while a discrepancy is found for NGC 2516; we provide evidence
supporting our own determination. Inferred cluster ages are robust against
models and are generally consistent with literature values. The systematic
parallax errors inherent in the Gaia DR1 data presently limit the precision of
our results. Nevertheless, we have been able to place these eight clusters onto
the same age scale for the first time, with good agreement between isochronal
and LDB ages where there is overlap. Our approach appears promising and
demonstrates the potential of combining Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic
datasets.

solar cells (PSCs) is becoming highly competitive, a design scheme to maximize
carrier transport towards higher power efficiency has been urgently demanded.
Here, we unravel a hidden role of A-site cation of PSCs in carrier transport
which has been largely neglected, i.e., tuning the Frohlich electron-phonon
(e-ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. The key
for steering Frohlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the
number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ion. The coordination to I
alleviates electron-phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective
charge or absorbing the LO motion of I. This novel principle discloses lower
electron-phonon coupling by several promising organic cations including
hydroxyl-ammonium cation (NH$_3$OH$^+$) and possibly Li$^+$ solvating
methylamine (Li$^+$NH$_2$CH$_3$) than methyl-ammonium cation. A new perspective
on the role of A-site cation could help in improving power efficiency and

reactions cause poor rechargeability, efficiency, and cycle life and have
predominantly been ascribed to the reactivity of reduced oxygen species with
cell components. These species, however, cannot fully explain the side
reactions. Here we show that singlet oxygen forms at the cathode of a
lithium-oxygen cell during discharge and from the onset of charge, and accounts
for the majority of parasitic reaction products. The amount increases during
discharge, early stages of charge, and charging at higher voltages, and is
enhanced by the presence of trace water. Superoxide and peroxide appear to be
involved in singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxygen traps and quenchers can
reduce parasitic reactions effectively. Awareness of the highly reactive

future research towards achieving highly reversible cell operation.

  Solid Electrolyte Li-Doped MgAl$_2$O$_4$","  (Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel (Li$_x$Mg$_{1-2x}$Al$_{2+x}$O$_4$) is a
solid lithium-ion electrolyte with potential use in all-solid-state lithium-ion
batteries. Interfaces with spinel electrodes, such as Li$_y$Mn$_2$O$_4$ and
Li$_{4+3z}$Ti$_5$O$_{12}$, may be lattice-matched, with potentially low
interfacial resistances. Small lattice parameter differences across a
lattice-matched interface are unavoidable, causing residual epitaxial strain.
This strain potentially modifies lithium diffusion near the interface,
contributing to interfacial resistance. Here we report a density functional
theory study of strain effects on lithium diffusion pathways for
(Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel, for $x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.25$ and
$x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.5$. We have calculated diffusion profiles for the
un-strained materials, and for isotropic and biaxial tensile strains of up to
6%, corresponding to {100} epitaxial interfaces with Li$_y$Mn$_2$O$_4$ and
Li$_{4+3z}$Ti$_5$O$_{12}$. We find that isotropic tensile strain reduces
lithium diffusion barriers by as much as 0.32 eV, with typical barriers reduced
by ~0.1 eV. This effect is associated with increased volumes of transitional
octahedral sites, and broadly follows local electrostatic potentials. For
biaxial (epitaxial) strain changes in octahedral site volumes and in lithium
diffusion barriers are much smaller than under isotropic strain. Typical
barriers are reduced by only ~ 0.05 eV. Individual effects, however, depend on
the pathway considered and the relative strain orientation. These results
predict that isotropic strain strongly affects ionic conductivities in
(Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel electrolytes, and that tensile strain is a
potential route to enhanced lithium transport. For a lattice-matched interface
with candidate spinel-structured electrodes epitaxial strain has a small, but
complex, effect on lithium diffusion barriers.

under a constant current load, and hence voltage vs. time measurements under
this condition may be accessible in practice. This paper presents a data-driven
diagnostic technique, Gaussian Process regression for In-situ Capacity
Estimation (GP-ICE), which estimates battery capacity using voltage
measurements over short periods of galvanostatic operation. Unlike previous
works, GP-ICE does not rely on interpreting the voltage-time data as
Incremental Capacity (IC) or Differential Voltage (DV) curves. This overcomes
the need to differentiate the voltage-time data (a process which amplifies
measurement noise), and the requirement that the range of voltage measurements
encompasses the peaks in the IC/DV curves. GP-ICE is applied to two datasets,
consisting of 8 and 20 cells respectively. In each case, within certain voltage
ranges, as little as 10 seconds of galvanostatic operation enables capacity
estimates with approximately 2-3% RMSE.

exploring the possible impact of $\mathrm{LiH}$ cooling, which has been
neglected in previous simulations of non-linear collapse. Specifically, we find
that at redshift $z\gtrsim 5$, the cooling by $\mathrm{LiH}$ has no effect on
the thermal evolution of shocked primordial gas, and of collapsing primordial
gas into minihaloes or relic HII regions, even if the primordial lithium
abundance were enhanced by one order of magnitude. Adding the most important
lithium species to a minimum network of primordial chemistry, we demonstrate
that insufficient $\mathrm{LiH}$ is produced in all cases considered, about
$[\mathrm{LiH/Li}]\sim 10^{-9}$ for $T\lesssim 100$ K. Indeed, $\mathrm{LiH}$
cooling would only be marginally significant in shocked primordial gas for the
highly unlikely case that the $\mathrm{LiH}$ abundance were increased by nine
orders of magnitude, implying that $all$ lithium would have to be converted
into $\mathrm{LiH}$. In this study, photo-destruction processes are not
considered, and the collisional disassociation rate of $\mathrm{LiH}$ is
possibly underestimated, rendering our results an extreme upper limit.
Therefore, the cooling by $\mathrm{LiH}$ can safely be neglected for the
thermal evolution of Population~III star-forming gas.

otherwise would have strong impact on the stellar evolution, can be neglected.
The observed differences are determined by the difference in stellar mass

accuracy than the actual stellar mass. In this work, we aim to study the
eccentric binary system KIC9163796, whose two components are very close in mass
and both are low-luminosity red-giant stars from four years of Kepler space
photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy with Hermes. Mass and radius of the

5.35+/-0.09 Ro, resp. From spectral disentangling the mass ratio was found to
be 1.015+/-0.005 and that the secondary is ~600K hotter than the primary.
Evolutionary models place both components, in the early and advanced stage of
the first dredge-up event on the red-giant branch. From theoretical models of
the primary, we derived the internal rotational gradient. From a grid of
models, the measured difference in lithium abundance is compared with
theoretical predictions. The surface rotation of the primary is determined from
the Kepler light curve and resembles the orbital period within 10 days. The
radial rotational gradient between the surface and core is found to be
6.9+2.0/-1.0. The agreement between the surface rotation with the seismic
result indicates that the full convective envelope is rotating quasi-rigidly.
The models of the lithium abundance are compatible with a rigid rotation in the
radiative zone during the main sequence. Because of the many constraints
offered by oscillating stars in binary systems, such objects are important test
beds of stellar evolution.

analysis of the electronic and structural properties of lithium silicides

that coordination of Si atoms in Li$_{x}$Si decreases with increase in Li

a-Li$_{x}$Si alloys Si tends to cluster forming Si-Si covalent bonds even at
the high lithium concentration. It is demonstrated that the Si-L$_{2,3}$

different spectral dependencies reflecting the process of disintegration of
Si-Si network into Si clusters and chains of the different sizes upon Si
lithiation. The Si-L$_{2,3}$ emission band of Li$_{x}$Si alloys become narrower
and shifts towards higher energies with an increase in Li concentration. The
shape of the emission band depends on the relative contribution of the X-ray
radiation from the Si atoms having different coordination. This feature of the

  Relaxor Ferroelectrics","  \indent It is a generally accepted fact that the unique dielectric properties
of relaxor ferroelectrics are related to the formation of polar nanoregion
(PNRs). Less well recognized is the corollary that, because they are polar and
therefore lack inversion symmetry, PNRs are also piezoelectric at the nanoscale
and can therefore behave as nanoresonators. Using the particular relaxor
ferroelectric K$_{\tt1-x}$Li$_{\tt x}$TaO$_{\tt 3}$ (KLT), we show that, when
electrically excited into oscillation, these piezoelectric nanoresonators can
drive macroscopic electro-mechanical resonances. Unexpectedly however, pairs of
coupled resonances are observed, with one of the two exhibiting a
characteristic Fano-like lineshape. The complex resonance spectra can be
described equally well by two alternative but complementary models both
involving two resonances coupled through a relaxation: a purely classical one
based on two coupled damped harmonic oscillators and a semi-classical based on
two discrete excitations coupled to each other through a continuum. Together,
they provide complementary perspectives on the underlying physics of the
system. Both reproduce the rapid evolution of the resonance spectrum across
three wide temperature ranges, including a phase transition range. In the high
temperature range, the coupling between modes is due to the collective $\pi$
relaxation of the lithium ions within PNRs and in the phase transition range to
""heterophase relaxation"" of the surrounding lattice between its high
temperature cubic and low temperature tetragonal phases. The coupling is
suppressed in the intermediate range of the collective $\pi/2$ relaxation of
the lithium ions. Incidentally, the measured dielectric spectra are shown to
bear a surprising but justifiable resemblance to the optical spectra of certain
atomic vapors that exhibit electromagnetically induced transparency.

temperature field theory, was recently proposed. The field theory is a
scale-free formalism, thus, it denies absolute values of thermodynamic
temperature and uses dimensionless thermal variables, which are obtained with
the group velocities of sound and the interatomic distance. This formalism was
previously applied to the specific heat of condensed matter and predicted its
fourth power of temperature behaviour at sufficiently low temperatures, which
was tested by experimental data for diamond lattice materials. The range of
temperatures with the quartic law varies for different materials, therefore, it
is called the quasi-low temperature regime. The quasi-low temperature behavior
of specific heat is verified here with experimental data for the fcc lattice
materials, silver chloride and lithium iodide. The conjecture that the fourth
order behavior is universal for all condensed matter systems is also supported
the data for glassy matter: vitreous silica. This law is long known to hold for
the bcc solid helium-4. The characteristic temperatures of the threshold of the
quasi-low temperature regime are found for the studied materials. The scaling
in the specific heat of condensed matter is expressed by the dimensionless
parameter, which is explored with the data for several glasses. The explanation
of the correlation of the 'boson peak' temperature with the shear velocity is
proposed. The critique of the Debye theory of specific heat and the Born-von
Karman model of the lattice dynamics is given.

acid (HCl) has led to the discovery of their hydrogen-ordered counterparts ices
XIII, XV and XIV. Yet, the mechanistic details of the hydrogen-ordering phase
transitions are still not fully understood. This includes in particular the
role of the acid dopant and the defect dynamics that it creates within the
ices. Here we investigate the effects of several acid and base dopants on the
hydrogen ordering of ices V and VI with calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. HCl
is found to be most effective for both phases which is attributed to a
favourable combination of high solubility and strong acid properties which
create mobile H3O+ defects that enable the hydrogen-ordering processes.
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the second most effective dopant highlighting that
the acid strengths of HCl and HF are much more similar in ice than they are in
liquid water. Surprisingly, hydrobromic acid doping facilitates hydrogen
ordering in ice VI whereas only a very small effect is observed for ice V.
Conversely, lithium hydroxide (LiOH) doping achieves a performance comparable
to HF-doping in ice V but it is ineffective in the case of ice VI. Sodium
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide (as previously shown) and perchloric acid doping
are ineffective for both phases. These findings highlight the need for future
computational studies but also raise the question why LiOH-doping achieves
hydrogen-ordering of ice V whereas potassium hydroxide doping is most effective

  seven EMP stars","  Extremely metal-poor stars provide us with indirect information on the first
generations of massive stars. The TOPoS survey has been designed to increase
the census of these stars and to provide a chemical inventory that is as
detailed as possible. Seven of the most iron-poor stars have been observed with
the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT Kueyen 8.2m telescope to refine their
chemical composition. We analysed the spectra based on 1D LTE model
atmospheres, but also used 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar
atmospheres. We measured carbon in six of the seven stars: all are
carbon-enhanced and belong to the low-carbon band, defined in the TOPoS II
paper. We measured lithium (A(Li)=1.9) in the most iron-poor star (SDSS
J1035+0641, [Fe/H] < -5.2 ). We were also able to measure Li in three stars at
[Fe/H]~ -4.0, two of which lie on the Spite plateau. We confirm that SDSS
J1349+1407 is extremely rich in Mg, but not in Ca. It is also very rich in Na.
Several of our stars are characterised by low alpha-to-iron ratios. The lack of
high-carbon band stars at low metallicity can be understood in terms of
evolutionary timescales of binary systems. The detection of Li in SDSS
J1035+0641 places a strong constraint on theories that aim at solving the
cosmological lithium problem. The Li abundance of the two warmer stars at
[Fe/H]~ -4.0 places them on the Spite plateau, while the third, cooler star,
lies below. We argue that this suggests that the temperature at which Li
depletion begins increases with decreasing [Fe/H]. SDSS J1349+1407 may belong
to a class of Mg-rich EMP stars. We cannot assess if there is a scatter in
alpha-to-iron ratios among the EMP stars or if there are several discrete
populations. However, the existence of stars with low alpha-to-iron ratios is
supported by our observations.

several scenarios including a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO)-composite coated SPCT

the battery assembly. By twisting the cathode filament and anode filament
together using a customized jig, the batteries are then assembled. The
open-circuit voltage is found to be ~ 2.3 V for the battery using the LTO@SPCT
anode, and ~3.3 V for the battery using the tin@SPCT anode and the tin wire
anode. Charge-discharge tests are carried out at different C rates for each
battery sample. Experimental results suggest that the LIBs using the LTO@SPCT
anode, the tin@SPCT anode and the bare tin wire anode could achieve a specific
capacity of ~64, ~67, and ~96 mAh/g, respectively, when charge-discharged at
0.5-C rate. The battery could retain well its capacity after 80
charge-discharge cycles. During operation of all the batteries reported in this
paper, their coulombic efficiency remained above 80%. Among the advantages of
the proposed LIB are light weight, ease of fabrication, high specific

our batteries, makes them potentially suitable for integration into wearables
using various standard textile manufacturing techniques.

theoretical scheme formulated in this study allows one to describe the dynamics

this theory with the generalized hydrodynamics and with the viscoelastic

We then use these geometries to compute the energy of formations. Additionally,
we determine that all ions are favorable in the structure, but interlayer
positions are preferred compared to vacancy positions. We also conclude that
the exchange between the interlayer and vacancy positions is a process which
involves the interaction between interlayer water and surface hydroxyl groups
next to the titanate layer. We observe a cooperative effect between structural
water and $\text{OH}$ groups to assist alkali-ions to move from the interlayer

prototypical structure to investigate both the migration mechanism of ions

is studied in detail. The chosen molecule under study, lithium fluoride (LiF),
is characterized by the presence of an avoided crossing between the two lowest
$^1\Sigma$ potential energy curves (covalent-ionic diabatic crossing). Without
field, after prompt excitation from the ground state $1\; ^1\Sigma$, the
excited nuclear wave packet moves back and forth in the upper $2\; ^1\Sigma$
state, but in the proximity of the avoided crossing, the non-adiabatic coupling
transfers part of the nuclear wave packet to the lower $1\; ^1\Sigma$ state,
which eventually leads to dissociation. The quantized field of a cavity also
induces an additional light crossing in the modified dressed potential energy
curves with similar transfer properties. To understand the entangled
photonic-nuclear dynamics we solve the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation by
using the multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree method (MCTDH). The
single mode quantized field of the cavity is represented in the coordinate
space instead of in the Fock space, which allows us to deal with the field as
an additional vibrational mode within the MCTDH procedure on equal footing. We
prepare the cavity with different quantum states of light, namely, Fock states,
coherent states and squeezed coherent states. Our results reveal pure quantum
light effects on the molecular photodynamics and the dissociation yields of
LiF, which are quite different from the light-undressed case and that cannot be
described in general by a semiclassical approach using classical
electromagnetic fields.

ions occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel. We have
obtained the atomic projections of the electronic band structure and density of
states, showing that the normal LiMn$_2$O$_4$ has half-metallic properties,
while the fully inverse spinel is an insulator. This material is in the
ferrimagnetic state for the inverse and partially inverse cation arrangement.
The optimised lattice and oxygen parameters, as well as the equilibrium degree

compositional control of that layer. In recent years, experiments and ab initio
simulations have identified dilithium ethylene dicarbonate (Li2EDC) as the
dominant component of SEI layers. Here, we adopt a parameterized,
non-polarizable MD force field for Li2EDC to study transport characteristics of
Li+ in this model SEI layer at moderate temperatures. The observed correlations
are consistent with recent MD results using a polarizable force field,
suggesting that this non-polarizable model is effective for our purposes of
investigating Li+ dynamics over long time scales. Mean-squared displacements
distinguish three distinct Li+ transport regimes in EDC ballistic, trapping,
and diffusive. Compared to liquid ethylene carbonate (EC), the nanosecond
trapping times in EDC are significantly longer and naturally decrease at higher
temperatures. New materials developed for fast-charging Li-ion batteries should
have smaller trapping regions. The analyses implemented in this paper can be
used for testing transport of Li+ ion in novel battery materials. Non-Gaussian
features of van Hove self -correlation functions for Li+ in EDC, along with the
mean-squared displacements, are consistent in describing EDC as a glassy
material compared with liquid EC. Vibrational modes of Li+ ion, identified by
MD, characterize the trapping and are further validated by electronic structure
calculations.

second generation stars, requiring at least two kind of polluters. To have

program to develop a primary pressure standard that is based on ultra-cold
atoms, covering a pressure range of 1 x 10-6 to 1 x 10-10 Pa and possibly
lower. These pressures correspond to the entire ultra-high vacuum range and
extend into the extreme-high vacuum. This cold-atom vacuum standard (CAVS) is
both a primary standard and absolute sensor of vacuum. The CAVS is based on the
loss of cold, sensor atoms (such as the alkali-metal lithium) from a magnetic
trap due to collisions with the background gas (primarily H2) in the vacuum.
The pressure is determined from a thermally-averaged collision cross section,
which is a fundamental atomic property, and the measured loss rate. The CAVS is
primary because it will use collision cross sections determined from ab initio
calculations for the Li + H2 system. Primary traceability is transferred to
other systems of interest using sensitivity coefficients.

degradation at short wavelengths with the emergence of systematic spectral
features with an amplitude of about one percent. We show that these features

systematically over-estimate the strength of metal lines and under-estimate
that of Lithium. We also identify the existence of artifacts due to masking and

optical spectra. All these effects occur in the rest-frame of the standard

statistical and systematic error estimates) for the stars. The radius of the
secondary star is in agreement with theory. The primary, however, is
approximately $15\%$ smaller than reasonable isochrones for the cluster
predict. Our best explanation is that the primary star was produced from the
merger of two stars, as this can also account for the non-detection of
photospheric lithium and its higher temperature relative to other cluster main
sequence stars at the same $V$ magnitude. To understand the dynamical
characteristics (low measured rotational line broadening of the primary star
and the low eccentricity of the current binary orbit), we believe that the most
probable (but not the only) explanation is the tidal evolution of a close
binary within a primordial triple system (possibly after a period of
Kozai-Lidov oscillations), leading to merger approximately 1Gyr ago. This star
appears to be a future blue straggler that is being revealed as the cluster
ages and the most massive main sequence stars die out.

This problem arises in a number of practical applications, including generation
of artificial porous medium for an electrode of lithium-ion batteries, for
composed materials, etc. A generated image represents a porous medium and, as
such, it is subject to two sets of constraints: topological constraints on the
structure and process constraints on the physical process over this structure.
To perform image generation we need to define a mapping from a porous medium to
its physical process parameters. For a given geometry of a porous medium, this
mapping can be done by solving a partial differential equation (PDE). However,
embedding a PDE solver into the search procedure is computationally expensive.
We use a binarized neural network to approximate a PDE solver. This allows us
to encode the entire problem as a logical formula. Our main contribution is
that, for the first time, we show that this problem can be tackled using
decision procedures. Our experiments show that our model is able to produce
random constrained images that satisfy both topological and process

transition at about 80 GPA and a reentrant semiconductor to metal transition
near 120 GPA. This unusual behaviour has been attributed to the formation of
high-pressure electrides in the Li-\textit{Aba}2 phase. Using the accurate wave
function based quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method, we show that the valence
charge distribution of the Li-\textit{Aba}2 phase is incompatible with an
insulating or semiconducting ground state. At DMC level, the most stable phase
at 100 GPA is an orthorhombic oP24 structure with Pbca symmetry whose valence
charge density shows an electride paired distribution, in correspondence with
the theoretical predictions of Neaton and Ashcroft [Nature 00, 141 (1999)].
Here, we propose the electride pairing in the oP24-(Pbca) phase as the origin

  Lithium","  The lithium doublet at 6708 \AA\ provides an age diagnostic for main sequence
FGK dwarfs. We measured the abundance of lithium in 1305 stars with detected
transiting planets from the Kepler Mission using high-resolution spectroscopy.
Our catalog of lithium measurements from this sample have a range of abundance
from A(Li) = 3.11 $\pm$ 0.07 to an upper limit of $-$0.84 dex. For a
magnitude-limited sample that comprises 960 of the 1305 stars, our Keck-HIRES
spectra have a median S/N = 45 per pixel at $\sim$6700 \AA\ with spectral
resolution $\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}$ = $R$ = 55,000. We identify 80
young stars that have A(Li) values greater than the Hyades at their respective
effective temperatures; these stars are younger than $\sim$650 Myr old, the
approximate age of the Hyades. We then compare the distribution of A(Li) with
planet size, multiplicity, orbital period, and insolation flux. We find larger
planets preferentially in younger systems, with an A-D two-sided test p-value =
0.002, a $>3\sigma$ confidence that the older and younger planet samples do not
come from the same parent distribution. This is consistent with planet
inflation/photoevaporation at early ages. The other planet parameters ($Kepler$
planet multiplicity, orbital period, and insolation flux) are uncorrelated with
age.

  clusters","  Context. The origin and dynamical evolution of star clusters is an important
topic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been proposed to understand
the formation of bound and unbound clusters and their evolution, and these can
be tested by examining the kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters
over a wide range of ages and masses. Aims. We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products
to study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that lie
in the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. Methods. We employ the gravity index
$\gamma$ and the equivalent width of the lithium line at 6708 $\AA$, together
with effective temperature $\rm{T_{eff}}$, and the metallicity of the stars in
order to discard observed contaminant stars. Then, we derive the cluster radial
velocity dispersions $\sigma_c$, the total cluster mass $\rm{M}_{tot}$, and the
half mass radius $r_{hm}$. Using the $Gaia$-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we
independently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters from the
astrometric parameters of cluster members. Results. The intrinsic radial
velocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data are larger than those
derived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the different masses of the
considered stars. Using $\rm{M}_{tot}$ and $r_{hm}$ we derive the virial
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{vir}$ and we find that three out of four clusters
are supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these
clusters are dispersing, as predicted by the ""residual gas expulsion"" scenario.
However, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of young star clusters
may be overestimated if it is determined using the global velocity dispersion,
since the clusters are not fully relaxed.

expected to be present in emission from the hot intracluster medium (ICM) of

We perform a set of experiments using the Lawrence Livermore National

In this work, the dynamic dielectric response and optical properties of the
high-pressure electride phases of cI16, oC40 and oC24 in lithium spanning a
wide pressure range from 40 to 200 GPa by first-principles calculations are
reported. Both interband and intraband contribution to the dielectric function
are deliberately treated with the linear response theory. One intraband and two
interband plasmons in cI16 at 70 GPa induced by a structural distortion at 2.1,
4.1, and 7.7 eV are discovered, which make the reflectivity of this weak
metallic phase abnormally lower than the insulating phase oC40 at the
corresponding frequencies. More strikingly, oC24 as a reentrant metallic phase
with higher conductivity becomes more transparent than oC40 in infrared and
visible light range due to its unique electronic structure around Fermi
surface. An intriguing reflectivity anisotropy in both oC40 and oC24 is
predicted, with the former being strong enough for experimental detection
within the spectrum up to 10 eV. The important role of interstitial localized
electrons is highlighted, revealing diversity and rich physics in electrides.

the Li - T_eff plane sparsely populated by stars. Here we analyze some of the
explanations that have been suggested for this region, including mixing in the
late main sequence, a Li dip origin for stars with low Li abundances in the
region, and a possible relation with the presence of planets. To study the Li
desert, we measured the atmospheric parameters and Li abundance of 227 late-F
dwarfs and subgiants, chosen to be in the T_eff range of the desert and without
previous Li abundance measurements. Subsequently, we complemented those with
literature data to obtain a homogeneous catalog of 2318 stars, for which we
compute masses and ages. We characterize stars surrounding the region of the Li
desert. We conclude that stars with low Li abundances below the desert are more
massive and more evolved than stars above the desert. Given the unexpected
presence of low Li abundance stars in this effective temperature range, we
concentrate on finding their origin. We conclude that these stars with low Li
abundance do not evolve from stars above the desert: at a given mass, stars
with low Li (i.e., below the desert) are more metal-poor. Instead, we suggest
that stars below the Li desert are consistent with having evolved from the Li
dip, discarding the need to invoke additional mixing to explain this feature.
Thus, stars below the Li desert are not peculiar and are only distinguished
from other subgiants evolved from the Li dip in that their combination of
atmospheric parameters locates them in a range of effective temperatures where
otherwise only high Li abundance stars would be found (i.e., stars above the
desert).

different structural motifs to the partial pair correlation functions (PPCF)
were determined. Particle configurations obtained from MD simulations were

were fitted together with the experimental structure factors to construct
structural models that are as consistent as possible with both the experimental

according to the quality of the fits. Although none of the tested MD models can
describe the structure perfectly at the highest investigated concentration,

  Modulator Beyond 100 GHz Bandwidth","  Electro-optic modulation, the imprinting of a radio-frequency (RF) waveform
on an optical carrier, is one of the most important photonics functions, being
crucial for high-bandwidth signal generation, optical switching, waveform
shaping, data communications, ultrafast measurements, sampling, timing and
ranging, and RF photonics. Although silicon (Si) photonic electro-optic
modulators (EOMs) can be fabricated using wafer-scale technology compatible
with the semiconductor industry, such devices do not exceed an electrical 3-dB
bandwidth of about 50 GHz, whereas many applications require higher RF
frequencies. Bulk Lithium Niobate (LN) and etched LN modulators can scale to
higher bandwidths, but are not integrated with the Si photonics fabrication
process adopted widely over the last decade. As an alternative, an
ultra-high-bandwidth Mach-Zehnder EOM based on Si photonics is shown, made
using conventional lithography and wafer-scale fabrication, bonded to an
unpatterned LN thin film. This hybrid LN-Si MZM achieves beyond 100 GHz 3-dB
electrical bandwidth. Our design integrates silicon photonics light
input/output and optical components, including directional couplers, low-radius
bends, and path-length difference segments, realized in a foundry Si photonics
process. The use of a simple low-temperature (200C) back-end integration
process to bond a postage-stamp-sized piece of LN where desired, and achieving
light routing into and out of LN to harness its electro-optic property without
any etching or patterning of the LN film, may be broadly-useful strategies for
advanced integrated opto-electronic microchips.

wavelength-agile nonlinear optical frequency synthesizers. So far, the most
flexible phase-matching technique, i.e. quasi phase matching, has not been
applied in this configuration. The reason is the lack of suitable thin films
with alternating crystal structure on a low-refractive-index substrate. Here,
we demonstrate an innovative method of realizing thin film substrates suitable
for quasi phase matching by field-assisted domain engineering of lithium
niobate, and subsequent direct bonding and polishing. We are able to fabricate
high-Q on-chip WGRs with these substrates by using standard semiconductor
manufacturing techniques. The Q-factors of the resonators are up to one
million, which allows us to demonstrate quasi-phase-matched second-harmonic
generation in on-chip WGRs for the first time. The normalized conversion
efficiency is $9\times 10^{-4}\,\textrm{mW}^{-1}$. This method can also be
transferred to other material systems.

low-loss acoustic delay lines. The 4-port circulator is built upon a recently
reported frequency-independent, programmable, non-reciprocal framework based on
switched delay lines. The design space for such a system, including the origins
of the insertion loss and harmonic responses, is theoretically investigated,
illustrating that the key to better performance and low-cost modulation signal
synthesis lies in a large delay. To implement a large delay, we resort to
in-house fabricated low-loss, wide-band lithium niobate (LiNbO3) SH0 mode
acoustic delay lines employing single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDT).
The 4-port circulator, consisting of two switch modules and one delay line
module, has been modularly designed, assembled, and tested. The design process
employs time-domain full circuit simulation and the results match well with
measurements. A 18.8 dB non-reciprocal contrast between insertion loss (IL =
6.6 dB) and isolation (25.4 dB) has been achieved over a fractional bandwidth
of 8.8% at a center frequency 155 MHz, using a record low switching frequency
of 877.19 kHz. The circulator also shows 25.9 dB suppression for the
intra-modulated tone and 30 dBm for IIP3. Upon further development, such a
system can potentially lead to future wide-band, low-loss chip-scale
nonreciprocal RF systems with unprecedented programmability.

Ion Battery (NIB) technologies lies in finding the better electrode materials.
Experimental investigations revealed the real potency of Germanium (Ge) as
suitable anode materials for NIBs. However, a systematic atomistic study is
necessary to understand the fundamental aspects of capacity-voltage

potential and capacity correlation for intermediate equilibrium structures and
compared our data with the experimental results. Effect of sodiation on
inter-atomic distances within Na-Ge system is analyzed by means of Pair
Correlation Function (PCF). This provides insight into possible microstructural
changes taking place during sodiation of amorphous Ge (a-Ge). We further
investigated the diffusivity of sodium in a-Ge electrode material and analyzed

Our method can also be applied to general optimisation problems and quantum

Recent development of the integrated lithium niobate (LN) technology makes it
possible to achieve a large wavelength tuning while maintaining a high
conversion efficiency. Here we report on-chip SHG that simultaneously achieves
a large tunability and a high conversion efficiency inside a single device. We
utilize the unique strong thermo-optic birefringence of LN to achieve flexible
temperature tuning of type-I inter-modal phase matching. We experimentally
demonstrate spectral tuning with a tuning slope of 0.84 nm/K for a telecom-band

networks, which can be considered as a simple case of geometrical frustration.
By performing neutron powder diffraction experiments and magnetization
measurements, we find that long-range magnetic order cannot be established in
LiNixMnyCozO2 even at low temperature of 3 K. Remarkably, the frustration
parameters of these compounds are estimated to be larger than 30, indicating
the existence of strongly frustrated magnetic interactions between spins of TM
ions. As frustration will inevitably give rise to lattice instability, the
formation of Li/Ni exchange in LiNixMnyCozO2 will help to partially relieve the
degeneracy of the frustrated magnetic lattice by forming a stable
antiferromagnetic state in hexagonal sublattice with nonmagnetic ions located
in centers of the hexagons. Moreover, Li/Ni exchange will introduce 180{\deg}
superexchange interaction, which further relieves the magnetic frustration
through bringing in new exchange paths. Thus, the variation of Li/Ni exchange
ratio vs. TM mole fraction in LiNixMnyCozO2 with different compositions can be
well understood and predicted in terms of magnetic frustration and
superexchange interactions. This provides a unique viewpoint to study the Li/Ni

growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of the most
promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a
computational screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability
to suppress dendrite initiation in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for
mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces that can be used in stability
criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are usually
obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to
obtain a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict
the mechanical properties of several new solid electrolytes. We train a
convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk moduli purely on structural
features of the material. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge regression
to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the
size of the training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us
direct interpretability by revealing the dominant structural features affecting
the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase with a decrease in
volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in
sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance
suggests our models generalize well. We predict over 20 mechanically
anisotropic interfaces between Li metal and 6 solid electrolytes which can be
used to suppress dendrite growth. Our screened candidates are generally soft
and highly anisotropic, and present opportunities for simultaneously obtaining
dendrite suppression and high ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes.

  upscaling, and universality","  We consider the evolution of interfaces in binary mixtures permeating
strongly heterogeneous systems such as porous media. To this end, we first
review available thermodynamic formulations for binary mixtures based on
\emph{general reversible-irreversible couplings} and the associated
mathematical attempts to formulate a \emph{non-equilibrium variational
principle} in which these non-equilibrium couplings can be identified as
minimizers.
  Based on this, we investigate two microscopic binary mixture formulations
fully resolving heterogeneous/perforated domains: (a) a flux-driven immiscible
fluid formulation without fluid flow; (b) a momentum-driven formulation for
quasi-static and incompressible velocity fields. In both cases we state two
novel, reliably upscaled equations for binary mixtures/multiphase fluids in
strongly heterogeneous systems by systematically taking thermodynamic features
such as free energies into account as well as the system's heterogeneity
defined on the microscale such as geometry and materials (e.g. wetting
properties). In the context of (a), we unravel a \emph{universality} with
respect to the coarsening rate due to its independence of the system's
heterogeneity, i.e. the well-known ${\cal O}(t^{1/3})$-behaviour for
homogeneous systems holds also for perforated domains.
  Finally, the versatility of phase field equations and their
\emph{thermodynamic foundation} relying on free energies, make the collected
recent developments here highly promising for scientific, engineering and
industrial applications for which we provide an example for lithium batteries.

by the standard stellar evolution models, and the mechanisms of Li enhancement
are still under debate. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) survey has obtained over six million spectra in the past
five years, and thus provides a great opportunity to search these rare objects
and to more clearly understand the mechanisms of Li enhancement. Based on the
high-resolution spectrum we obtained the stellar parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$,
$\log g$, [Fe/H]), and determined the elemental abundances of Li, C, N,
$\alpha$, Fe-peak, r-process, s-process elements, and the projected rotational
velocity. For a better understanding of the effect of mixing processes, we also
derived the $^{12}\rm{C}$ to $^{13}\rm{C}$ ratio, and constrained the
evolutionary status of TYC\,3251-581-1 based on the BaSTI stellar isochrones.
The super Li-rich giant TYC\,3251-581-1 has $\rm{A(Li)} = 3.51$, the average
abundance of two lithium lines at $\lambda = 6708$ \AA\ and 6104 \AA\ based on
the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis. The atmospheric
parameters show that our target locates on the luminosity function bump. The
low carbon isotopic ratio ($^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C} = 9.0 $), a slow rotational
velocity $v\sin i = 2.2\ \rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, and no sign of IR excess suggest
that additional mixing after first dredge up (FDU) should occur to bring
internal synthesized Li to the surface. The low carbon ($[\rm{C}/\rm{Fe}] \sim
-0.34$ ) and enhanced nitrogen ($[\rm{N}/\rm{Fe}] \sim 0.33$) are also
consistent with the sign of mixing. Given the evolutionary stage of
TYC\,3251-581-1 with the relatively low $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}$, the internal
production which replenishes Li in the outer layer is the most likely origin of
Li enhancement for this star.

  and Its Application in Li-Ion Batteries","  The liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) of black phosphorus (BP) is a strategic
route for the large-scale production of phosphorene and few-layer BP (FL-BP)
flakes. The exploitation of this exfoliated material in cutting-edge
technologies, e.g., in flexible electronics and energy storage, is however
limited by the fact that the LPE of BP is usually carried out at a high boiling
point and in toxic solvents. In fact, the solvent residual is detrimental to
device performance in real applications; thus, complete solvent removal is
critical. Here, we tackle these issues by exfoliating BP in different low
boiling-point solvents. Among these solvents, we find that acetone also
provides a high concentration of exfoliated BP, leading to the production of
FL-BP flakes with an average lateral size and thickness of c.a. 30 and 7 nm,
respectively. The use of acetone to produce less defective few-layer BP flakes
(FL-BPacetone) from bulk crystals is a straightforward process which enables
the rapid preparation of homogeneous thin films thanks to the fast solvent
evaporation. The ratio of edge to bulk atoms for the BP flakes here produced,
combined with the use of low-boiling-point solvents for the exfoliation process
suggests that these thin films are promising anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
To this end, we tested Li-ion half cells with FL-BPacetone anodes achieving a
reversible specific capacity of 480 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g,
over 100 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, a reversible specific capacity of
345 mAh/g is achieved for the FL-BPacetone-based anode at a high current
density (i.e., 1 A/g). These findings indicate that the FL-BPacetone-based
battery is promising with regards to the design of fast charge/discharge
devices. Overall, the presented process is a step forward toward the
fabrication of phosphorene-based devices.

  special?","  There is consensus on the fact that one of the main limitations of the Li air
batteries (LABs) is the insulating character of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ and that it
becomes crucial to explore new conduction paths. Recent studies indicate that
doping with chloride increases the ion conductivity of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$,
although to a much lesser extent than expected if chloride is assumed as a
donor dopant [Gerbig et al., Adv. Mater.,2013, 25, 3129]. Subsequently, it has
been shown that the addition of lithium chloride, LiCl, to the battery
electrolyte increases its discharge capacity while this effect is not observed
with other halogens [Matsuda et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2016, 120, 13360]. This
fact was attributed to an increase in the conductivity of Cl-doped
Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$, but still the responsible mechanism is not clear. In this
work, we have performed first principle calculations to study the effect of the
different halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) as substitutional defects in the electronic
and transport properties of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$. We have calculated the formation
energies of the different defects and impurities and we analysed how they
affect the activation barriers and diffusion coefficients . We have
demonstrated that the chloride does not behave like a donor dopant, thus
explaining the meager increase of the ionic conductivity experimentally
observed neither it promotes the polaron formation and its mobility. We have
also found that chloride does not present any special behaviour among the
halogen series. Our results reveal that all the studied configurations
associated with the halogen defects do not derive in metallic states nor extra
polarons that would increase considerably the electronic conductivity. This is
mainly due to the ionic characteristics of the Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ crystal and the
capability of the oxygen dimers to adapt its valence rather than to the nature
of the dopant itself.

We show that such unusual interference patterns, which are fundamentally
different from the acoustic displacement fields, stem from the nonlocal
interaction between electric fields and elastic waves. The results are
corroborated by numerical simulations taking into account the sign reversal of
piezoelectric tensor in oppositely polarized domains. Our work paves new ways

in two quasi one-dimensional trap configurations. The potentials can be created
by magnetic and optical traps, a symmetric trap from two offset Gaussian
barriers and a tilt trap from a linear gradient and Gaussian barrier. Scaling
laws in barrier parameters, ranging from inverse polynomial to square root
times exponential, are calculated and used to elucidate different dynamical
regimes, such as when classical oscillations dominate tunneling rates in the
symmetric trap. The symmetric trap is found to be versatile, with tunneling
times at and below one second, able to hold $10^{3}$ to $10^{4}$ atoms, and
realizable for atoms ranging from rubidium to lithium, with unadjusted
scattering lengths. The tilt trap produces sub-second tunneling times, is able
to hold a few hundred atoms of lighter elements like lithium, and requiring the
use of Feshbach resonance to reduce scattering lengths. To explore a large
parameter space, an extended Gaussian variational ansatz is used, which can
approximate large traps with Thomas-Fermi profiles. Nonlinear interactions in

  Glasses","  Alkali and alkaline earth aluminoborate glasses feature high resistance to
cracking under sharp contact loading compared to other oxide glasses. However,
due to the high content of hygroscopic B2O3, it is expected that applications
of these glasses could be hindered by poor chemical durability in aqueous
solutions. Indeed, the compositional and structural dependence of their
dissolution kinetics remains unexplored. In this work, we correlate the
dissolution rates of aluminoborate glasses in acidic, neutral, and basic
solutions with the structural changes induced by varying the aluminum-to-boron
ratio. In detail, we investigate a total of seventeen magnesium, lithium, and
sodium aluminoborate glasses with fixed modifier content of 25 mol%. We show
that the structural changes induced by alumina depend on the network modifier.
We also demonstrate a correlation between the chemical durability at various pH
values and the structural changes in Mg-, Li- and Na- aluminoborate glasses.
The substitution of alumina by boron oxide leads to a general decrease of
chemical corrosion in neutral and acidic solutions. The lowest dissolution rate
value is observed in Mg-aluminoborate glasses, as a consequence of the
intermediate character of magnesium which can increase the network
cross-linking. For basic solutions, the chemical durability is almost constant
for the different amount of alumina in the three series, likely because B2O3 is
susceptible to nucleophilic attack, which is favored in high-OH- solutions.

including the first Li-rich giant with evolutionary stage confirmed by CoRoT
data. Atmospheric parameters and abundances were derived in model atmosphere
analyses using medium-resolution GIRAFFE or high-resolution UVES spectra. These
results are part of the fifth internal data release of Gaia-ESO. The Li
abundances were corrected for non-LTE effects. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes to
estimate distances and luminosities. The giants have A(Li) > 2.2 dex. The
majority of them (14 out of 20 stars) are in the CoRoT fields. Four giants are
located in the field of three open clusters but are not members. Two giants
were observed in fields towards the Galactic bulge but are likely in the inner
disk. One of the bulge field giants is super Li-rich with A(Li) = 4.0 dex. We
identified one giant with infrared excess at 22 microns. Two other giants, with
large vsin i, might be Li-rich because of planet engulfment. Another giant is
found to be barium enhanced and thus could have accreted material from a former
AGB companion. Otherwise, besides the Li enrichment, the evolutionary stages
are the only other connection between these new Li-rich giants. The CoRoT data
confirm that one Li-rich giant is at the core-He burning stage. The other
giants are concentrated in close proximity to the RGB luminosity bump, the
core-He burning stages, or the early-AGB. This is very clear when looking at
the Gaia-based luminosities of the Li-rich giants. This is also seen when the
CoRoT Li-rich giants are compared to a larger sample of 2252 giants observed in
the CoRoT fields by the Gaia-ESO Survey, which are distributed all over the RGB
in the Teff-logg diagram. These observations show that evolutionary stage is a
major factor behind the Li enrichment in giants. Other processes, like planet
accretion, contribute to a smaller scale. [abridged]

  system: Size matters","  As a typical immiscible binary system, copper (Cu) and lithium (Li) show no
alloying and chemical intermixing under normal circumstances. A notable example
that takes advantages of the immiscibility between Cu and Li is the widespread
utilization of Cu foils as the anodic current collector in Li-ion batteries.
Here we show that the nanoscale size effect can play a subtle yet critical role
in mediating the chemical activity of Cu and therefore its miscibility with Li,
such that the electrochemical alloying and solid-state amorphization will occur
in such an immiscible system when decreasing Cu nanoparticle sizes into
ultrasmall range. This unusual observation was accomplished by performing
in-situ studies of the electrochemical lithiation processes of individual CuO
nanowires inside a transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Upon lithiation, CuO
nanowires are first electrochemically reduced to form discrete ultrasmall Cu
nanocrystals that, unexpectedly, can in turn undergo further electrochemical
lithiation to form amorphous CuLix nanoalloys. Real-time dynamic observations
by in-situ TEM unveil that there is a critical grain size (ca. 6 nm), below
which the crystalline Cu nanoparticles can be continuously lithiated and
amorphized. Electron energy loss spectra indicate that there is a net charge
transfer from Li to Cu in the amorphous CuLix nanoalloys. Another intriguing
finding is that the amorphous alloying phenomena in Cu-Li system is reversible,
as manifested by the in-situ observation of electron-beam-induced delithiation
of the as-formed amorphous CuLix nanoalloys.

space for optimization as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries. Recently, the
high cost and resource limitations of Co have added a new design constraint and
high Ni-containing NMC alloys have gained enormous attention despite possible
performance trade-offs. It is not fully understood if this material space is a
disordered solid solution at room temperature and any arbitrary combination can
be used or if there exist distinct transition metal orderings to which
meta-stable solid solutions will decay during cycling and affect performance.
Here, we present a high fidelity computational search of the ternary phase
diagram with an emphasis on high-Ni, and thus low Co, containing compositional
phases to understand the room temperature stability of the ordered and
disordered solid solution phases. This is done through the use of density
functional theory training data fed into a reduced order model Hamiltonian that
accounts for effective electronic and spin interactions of neighboring
transition metal atoms at various lengths in a background of fixed composition
and position lithium and oxygen atoms. This model can then be solved to include
finite temperature thermodynamics into a convex hull analysis to understand the
regions of ordered and disordered solid solution as well the transition metal
orderings within the ordered region of the phase diagram. We find that for the
majority of transition metal compositions of the layered material, specifically
medium to high-Ni content, prefer transition metal ordering and predict the
collection of preferred compositions in the ordered region.

separators, are commonly characterised in terms of their porosity and
tortuosity. The ratio of these values gives the effective transport of lithium
ions in the electrolyte-filled pore spaces, which can be used to determine the
ionic resistivity and corresponding voltage losses. Here, we show that these
microstructural characteristics are not sufficient. Analysis of tomographic
data of commercial separators reveals that different polyolefin separators have
similar porosity and through-plane tortuosity, which, in the homogenised
picture of lithium ion cell operation, would imply that these different
separators exhibit similar performance. However, numerical diffusion
simulations indicate that this is not the case. We demonstrate that the extent
to which lithium ion concentration gradients are induced or smoothed by the
separator structure is linked to pore space connectivity, a parameter that can
be determined by topological or network based analysis of separators. These
findings enable us to propose how to design separator microstructures that are
safer and accommodate fast charge and discharge.

desorption of lithium, we observe light-induced desorption of background gas

surface of lithium diffusing in a solid-state ionic conductor. First, we assume
that the Li atoms are fully ionized and we neglect the weak dependence of the
electronic valence charge density on the instantaneous position of the Li ions.
Second, we freeze the atoms of the host lattice in their equilibrium positions;
consequently, also the valence charge density is frozen. We thus obtain a
computational setup (the ""pinball model"") for which extremely inexpensive
molecular dynamics simulation can be performed. To assess the accuracy of the
model, we contrast it with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations
performed either with a free or frozen host lattice; in this latter case, the
charge density still readjusts itself self-consistently to the actual positions
of the diffusing Li ions. We show that the pinball model is able to reproduce
accurately the static and dynamic properties of the diffusing Li ions -
including forces, power spectra, and diffusion coefficients - when compared to
the self-consistent frozen-host lattice simulations. The frozen-lattice
approximation itself is often accurate enough, and certainly a good proxy in
most materials. These observations unlock efficient ways to simulating the

were carried out on the mixed alkali vanadate glass samples having lithium and
rubidium as alkali elements. The analysis of the data is done using
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation which describes the relaxation
behavior of the mobile species. We have used the Bergman equation (R. Bergman,
J. Apl. Phys. 88 (2000) 1356.) for fitting the imaginary part of the electrical
modulus. The stretching parameter beta derived from this fit shows a nonlinear
variation with respect to alkali content which is attributed to mixed alkali
effect. The variations of beta with respect to alkali element concentration is
analyzed on the basis of alkali ion distance and molar volume. It is found that
the coupling between the mobile ions is better at 50 mol percentage of the
alkali mixture when compared to single alkali concentrations. It is observed
that coupling between the ions are weak in case of all Rubidium glass than all
Lithium or Lithium-Rubidium mixture, even though the alkali concentration is on
the higher (30 mol percentage) side. The contributions from fast and slow types
of relaxation mechanisms were determined. It again shows that at low
concentrations of Rubidium ions, there exists a good coupling between alkali
ions and contribute to a macroscopic relaxation time responsible for the
stretching, whereas at high concentrations of Rubidium ions the relaxing sites
decouple and relax with a microscopic relaxation time. A scaling of modulus
spectra with respect to frequency shows that stretching parameter beta is
slightly dependent on temperature.

distributions, allowing us to rigorously determine suitable confidence

carry out tunneling spectroscopy in graphite(G)/BSCCO heterojunctions. We

example to analyse reaction rates in drug discovery and catalysis. There has
been significant progress in developing algorithms to calculate the ground
state energy of molecules on near-term quantum computers. However, calculating
excited state energies has attracted comparatively less attention, and it is
currently unclear what the optimal method is. We introduce a low depth,
variational quantum algorithm to sequentially calculate the excited states of
general Hamiltonians. Incorporating a recently proposed technique, we employ
the low depth swap test to energetically penalise the ground state, and
transform excited states into ground states of modified Hamiltonians. We use
variational imaginary time evolution as a subroutine, which deterministically
propagates towards the target eigenstate. We discuss how symmetry measurements
can mitigate errors in the swap test step. We numerically test our algorithm on
Hamiltonians which encode 3SAT optimisation problems of up to 18 qubits, and
the electronic structure of the Lithium Hydride molecule. As our algorithm uses
only low depth circuits and variational algorithms, it is suitable for use on
near-term quantum hardware.

challenge to enable widespread sustainable power generation has become making
renewables dispatchable. Low cost energy storage can provide this
dispatchability, but there is no clear technology that can meet the need.
Pumped hydroelectric and compressed air storage have low costs, but they are
geographically constrained. Similarly, lithium-ion batteries are becoming
ubiquitous, but even their lower bounding asymptote cost is too high to enable
cost-competitive dispatchable renewables. Here, we introduce a concept based on
thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) using a multijunction photovoltaic heat
engine (MPV) with promising initial experimental results that could meet the
low cost required to enable cost competitive dispatchable renewables. The
approach exploits an important tradeoff between the accession of an extremely
low cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity
directly, while paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To
understand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a framework
for evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency (RTE) as
a variable, in addition to cost per unit energy stored (CPE) and cost per unit
power (CPP). It is from this perspective that the TEGS-MPV concept offers a
compelling economic proposition.

dispersion of surface functionalized nanoparticles within it. The ionic
conductivity of the electrolytes shows unusual viscosity decoupled
characteristics and at the 5.0 wt% nanoparticle dispersion it attains a maximum
value, higher than that of pure IL host. As compared to pure IL-based
electrolytes, the ionanofluid electrolyte also possesses a significantly higher
value of lithium ion transference number. The Li/LiMn2O4 cell with the best
conducting ionanofluid electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of about 131

and a surface enriched in in lithium, calcium and various $irp$-process
elements. In this paper we re-examine this evidence, and present new

of lithium cations in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate and propylene
carbonate/dimethyl carbonate mixed electrolytes. The impact of the presence of
the counteranion on the solvation of Li+ in pure propylene carbonate and
dimethyl carbonate was also studied. The calculations revealed small
free-energy changes for the transitions between different preferred structures
in mixed solvents. This implies that transitions between distinct local
arrangements can take place in the mixtures. The addition of dimethyl carbonate
causes a significant increase of the dipole moment of solvation clusters,
indicating important molecular-scale modifications when dimethyl carbonate is
used as a co-solvent. The presence of an anion in the solvation shell of Li+
modifies the intermolecular structure comprising four carbonate molecules in
dilute solutions, allowing only two carbonate molecules to coordinate to Li+.
The bidentate complexation of Li+ with the anion electron donor atoms, however,
maintains the local tetrahedral structure on interatomic length scales. The
neutralization of the solvation shell of Li+ due to contact ion pair formation
and the consequent implications on the underlying mechanisms provide a rational
explanation for the ionic conductivity drop of electrolyte solutions at high

nonlinear optics. This material is robust and resistive to high temperatures,
which makes the LN-based devices table, but challenging to fabricate. In this
work we report on the design, manufacturing and characterization of engineered
dielectric media with thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) on top for the coupling
and propagation of electromagnetic surface waves at the telecommunication
wavelengths. The designed one-dimentional photonic crystal (1DPhC) sustains
Bloch surface waves at the multilayer/air interface at 1550 nm wavelength with
a propagation detected over a distance of 3 mm. The working wavelength and
improved BSW propagation parameters open the way for exploration of nonlinear
properties of BSW based devices. It is also expected that these novel devices
will modify BSW propagation and coupling by external thermal/electrical stimuli
due to the improved quality of the TFLN top layer of 1DPhC.

helium-like and lithium-like ions with static nuclei for $Z \leq 20$ the domain
of applicability of Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED) is localized for ground state
energy. It is demonstrated that for both helium-like and lithium-like ions with
$Z \leq 20$ the finite nuclear mass effects do not change 4-5 significant
digits (s.d.), and the leading relativistic and QED effects leave unchanged 3-4
s.d. in the ground state energy. It is shown that the non-relativistic ground
state energy can be interpolated with accuracy not less than 13 s.d. for $Z
\leq 12$, and not less than 12 s.d. for $Z \leq 50$ for helium-like as well as
for $Z \leq 20$ for lithium-like ions by a compact meromorphic function in
${\lambda}=\sqrt{Z-{Z_B}}$ ($Z_B$ is the 2nd critical charge, see {TLO:2016}),
$P_9(\lambda)/Q_5(\lambda)$. It is found that the Majorana formula - a second
degree polynomial in $Z$ with two free parameters - and a fourth degree
polynomial in ${\lambda}$ (a generalization of the Majorana formula) reproduce
the ground state energy of the helium-like and lithium-like ions for $Z \leq
20$ in the domain of applicability of NRQED, thus, at least, 3 s.d. It is noted
that $\gtrsim 99.9\%$ of the ground state energy is given by the variational
energy for properly optimized trial function of the form of (anti)-symmetrized
product of three (six) screened Coulomb orbitals for two-(three) electron
system with 3 (7) free parameters for $Z \leq 20$, respectively. It may imply
that these trial functions are, in fact, {\it exact} wavefunctions in
non-relativistic QED, thus, the NRQED effective potential can be derived. It is
shown that the sum of relativistic and QED effects in leading approximation - 3
s.d. - for both 2 and 3 electron systems is interpolated by 4th degree

2MASSJ04183483+2131275 (2M0418), sub-stellar evolutionary models predict a mass
in the range 39-55 Jupiter masses (M_Jup) which is insufficient to produce any
substantial lithium burning except for the very upper range >53 M_Jup. Our goal
is to measure the abundance of lithium in this object, test the consistency
between models and observations and refine constraints on the mass and age of
the object.
  We used the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) with its low-dispersion
optical spectrograph to obtain ten spectra of 2277s each covering the range
6300-10300 Angstroms with a resolving power of R~500.
  In the individual spectra, which span several months, we detect persistent
unresolved H_alpha in emission with pseudo equivalent widths (pEW) in the range
45-150 Angstroms and absorption lines of various alkalis with the typical
strengths found in objects of L5 spectral type. The lithium resonance line at
6707.8 Angstroms is detected with pEW of 18+/-4 Angstroms in 2M0418 (L5).
  We determine a lithium abundance of log N(Li) = 3.0+/-0.4 dex consistent with
a minimum preservation of 90% of this element which confirms 2M0418 as a brown
dwarf with a maximum mass of 52 M_Jup. We infer a maximum age for the Hyades of
775 Myr from a comparison with the BHAC15 models. Combining recent results from
the literature with our study, we constrain the mass of 2M0418 to 45-52 M_Jup
and the age of the cluster to 580-775 Myr (1 sigma) based on the lithium
depletion boundary method.

  solar-type stars I. Application to HD 207129 and HD 95456","  Convective motions in solar-type stellar atmospheres induce Doppler shifts
that affect the strengths and shapes of spectral absorption lines and create
slightly asymmetric line profiles. 1D LTE studies of elemental abundances are
not able to reproduce this phenomenon, which becomes particularly important
when modeling the impact of isotopic fine structure, like the subtle depression
created by the 6Li isotope on the red wing of the Li I resonance doublet line.
The purpose of this work is to provide corrections for the lithium abundance,
A(Li), and the 6Li/7Li ratio that can easily be applied to correct 1D LTE
lithium abundances in G and F dwarf stars of approximately solar mass and
metallicity for 3D and non-LTE (NLTE) effects. The corrections for A(Li) and
6Li/7Li are computed using grids of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line
profiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD and 1D hydrostatic model
atmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated by
analytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are
applied to adjust the 1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type
stars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D NLTE corrections range between
-0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li
ratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li
ratio, our corrections are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can
significantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage points) the presence of 6Li in
the atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars. These results emphasize the
importance of reliable 3D model atmospheres combined with NLTE line formation
for deriving precise isotopic lithium abundances. Although 3D NLTE spectral
synthesis implies an extensive computational effort, the results can be made
accessible with parametric tools like the ones presented in this work.

generation of devices for energy storage due to better performance and safety.
Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) based material becomes one of the best candidate of
solid electrolytes, while its thermal conductivity is crucial to heat
dissipation inside batteries. In this work, we study the thermal conductivity
of PEO by molecular dynamics simulation. By enhancing the structure order,
thermal conductivity of aligned crystalline PEO is obtained as high as 60 W/m-K
at room temperature, which is two orders higher than the value (0.37 W/m-K) of
amorphous structure. Interestingly, thermal conductivity of ordered structure
shows a significant stepwise negative temperature dependence, which is
attributed to the temperature-induced morphology change. Our study offers
useful insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern the thermal
conductivity of PEO but not hinder the ionic transport, which can be used for
the thermal management and further optimization of high-performance SSLIBs.

stability up to 300C. DSC analysis confirms the decrease of melting temperature
and signal of glass transition temperature with addition of nanofiller which
indicates the decrease of crystallinity of polymer matrix. An absolute
correlation between diffusion coefficient, ion mobility, number density, double

that are comparable with the width of the interface between the FP and the
LFP-phase. However, the extra kinetic parameter of the Allen-Cahn-type
description may be used to reduce the strength of the velocity-increase with
the decreasing particle size. Further, we consider the influence of anisotropic
and inhomogeneous elasticity on the lithiation-kinetics within a rectangularly
shaped LiFePO4-particle embedded in an elastically soft electrolyte. Finally,
the simulation of equilibrium shapes of LiFePO4-particles is discussed. Within

decay, a diagrammatic method that visualizes the structure of the nonadiabatic
reaction dynamics as a pattern of occurrence of dynamical events, such as
wavepacket bifurcation, turning, and dissociation, is developed. Using this
diagrammatic method, an analytical formula for the power-law decay is derived,
and the theoretical decay curve is compared with the corresponding numerical
decay curve computed by a wavepacket dynamics simulation in the case of lithium
fluoride. This study reveals that the cause of the power-law decay is the
quantum interference arising from the wavepacket bifurcation and merging due to
nonadiabatic transitions.

  Instead of using Matsubara frequencies one can also work directly in the

It has a large inclination, but there are no eclipses; only a 4.4 mmag light
modulation apparently caused by star spots on the components of this binary is
detected with Evryscope. Assuming a moderate extinction of A_V = 0.5 mag and a

rotation, suggests that the system is younger than 150 Myr. This object is
located behind the extension of the Chamaeleon I dark cloud (which explains
extinction and interstellar Sodium absorption), but apparently does not belong

  UBV Techniques & the Challenges of Rotation","  Main sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs
that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential
reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore,
stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and
evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters,
ranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations
can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers,
certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This
UBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and
estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities
create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common
isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters
using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the
photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes
find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older (>100 Myr) clusters,
like the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium
depletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within
~10% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the
Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with
lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly
diverge to become 30% to 80% younger. This illustrates the importance of
rotation for deriving ages in the youngest (<100 Myr) clusters.

rechargeable batteries that use lithium metal as the negative electrode, and
thereby can safely access higher energy density than available with today's
lithium ion batteries. To do so, the solid electrolyte must be able to suppress
morphological instabilities that lead to poor coulombic efficiency and, in the
worst case, internal short circuits. In this work, lithium electrodeposition
experiments were performed using single-crystal Li6La3ZrTaO12 garnet as solid
electrolyte layers to investigate the factors that determine whether lithium
penetration occurs through brittle inorganic solid electrolytes. In these
single crystals, grain boundaries are excluded as possible paths for lithium
metal propagation. However, Vickers microindentation was used to introduce
sharp surface flaws of known size. Using operando optical microscopy, it was
found that lithium metal penetration sometimes initiates at these controlled
surface defects, and when multiple indents of varying size were present,
propagates preferentially from the largest defect. However, a second class of
flaws was found to be equally or more important. At the perimeter of surface
current collectors, an enhanced electrodeposition current density causes
lithium metal filled cracks to initiate and grow to penetration, even when the
large Vickers defects are in close proximity. Modeling the electric field
concentration for the experimental configurations, it was shown that a factor
of 5 enhancement in field can readily occur within 10 micrometers of current
collector discontinuities, which we interpret as the origin of
electrochemomechanical stresses leading to failure. Such field amplification
may determine the sites where supercritical surface defects dominate lithium
metal propagation during electrodeposition, overriding the presence of larger
defects elsewhere.

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are well-studied, they make up less
than half of all EMP stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -3.0$. The amount of carbon
depletion occurring on the red giant branch (carbon offset) is used to
determine the evolutionary status of EMP stars, and this offset will differ
between CEMP and normal EMP stars. The depletion mechanism employed in stellar
models (from which carbon offfsets are derived) is very important, however the
only widely available carbon offsets in the literature are derived from stellar
models using a thermohaline mixing mechanism that cannot simultaneously match
carbon and lithium abundances to observations for a single diffusion
coeffcient. Our stellar evolution models utilise a modified thermohaline mixing
model that can match carbon and lithium in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC
6397. We compare our models to the bulk of the EMP star sample at [Fe/H] $= -3$
and show that our modified models follow the trend of the observations and
deplete less carbon compared to the standard thermohaline mixing theory. We
conclude that stellar models that employ the standard thermohaline mixing

population.

  two-dimensional BCS-BEC crossover","  Superconductivity mostly appears in high carrier density systems and
sometimes exhibits common phase diagrams in which the critical temperature Tc
continuously develops with carrier density. Superconductivity enhanced in
lightly doped regime has seldom been reported, although it is an ideal
direction towards the crossover between Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) limits, where the behavior of Cooper pairs
changes dramatically. Here we report transport properties and superconducting
gaps in single-crystalline lithium-intercalated layered nitrides (LixHfNCl and
LixZrNCl) down to the low-doping regime, enabled by a combination of ionic
gating device and tunneling spectroscopy. Upon the reduction of doping, both
systems display the increase of Tc, up to 24.9 K especially in LixHfNCl, with
the concomitant enhancement of two-dimensionality leading to a pseudogap state
below 35.5 K as well as the increase of superconducting coupling strengths
2D/kBTc reaching 5.9. Such behavior in the carrier density region as low as
10^20 cm-3 indicates that lightly doped two-dimensional superconductors exhibit
the unprecedented nature that is distinct from that in conventional
superconductors, and offer a new route to access BCS-BEC crossover.

being debated. Here we report the discovery of the most Li-rich giant known to

snapshotted together with another short-term event that the star is
experiencing its luminosity bump on the red giant branch. Such high Li
abundance indicates that the star might be at the very beginning of its Li-rich
phase, which provides a great opportunity to investigate the origin and
evolution of Li in the Galaxy. A detailed nuclear simulation is presented with
up-to-date reaction rates to recreate the Li enriching process in this star.
Our results provide tight constraints on both observational and theoretical
points of view, suggesting that low-mass giants can produce Li inside
themselves to a super high level via $^{7}$Be transportation during the red
giant phase.

terahertz radiation generated in each stage, extra absorption is circumvented
and effective interaction length is increased. The separation of the terahertz

out-coupler. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the governing 2-D coupled

previous evolutionary stage. Ivanova (2006) put forward the possibility that
some of the BHLMXBs may harbour pre-main-sequence (MS) donor stars, in order to
explain the Li-overabundances in three BHLMXBs. In this work we investigate the
evolution of low-mass pre-MS stars in binaries with a BH companion. We
calculate the evolution of the spin and orbital periods, the stellar radius and
the Roche-lobe radius during the pre-MS stage with the stellar evolution code
MESA. We find that, because of the relatively slow rotation of the pre-MS star
after the common envelope evolution and the long turnover time in the pre-MS
stars, tidal torque is not always able to synchronize the pre-MS star, so the
spin periods are generally longer than the orbital periods. Mass transfer can
occur only for stars with mass larger than $\sim 1.2M_\odot$, which experience
expansion due to nuclear reaction after the Hayashi contraction phase. The
effective temperatures and orbital periods of these systems do not match the
observations of BHLMXBs. Our results show that the observed BHLMXBs with
lithium overabundances are unlikely to host pre-main sequence donor stars.

  and a Methodology for Charge Correction","  Accurate identification of chemical phases associated with the electrode and
solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for understanding and
controlling interfacial degradation mechanisms in lithium containing battery
systems. To study these critical battery materials and interfaces X ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a widely used technique that provides
quantitative chemical insights. However, due to the fact that a majority of
chemical phases relevant to battery interfaces are poor electronic conductors,
phase identification that relies primarily on absolute XPS core level
binding-energies (BEs) can be problematic. Charging during XPS measurements
leads to BE shifts that can be difficult to correct. These difficulties are
often exacerbated by the coexistence of multiple Li containing phases in the
SEI with overlapping XPS core levels. To facilitate accurate phase
identification of battery relevant phases, we propose a straightforward
approach for removing charging effects from XPS data sets. We apply this
approach to XPS data sets acquired from six battery relevant inorganic phases
including lithium metal (Li0), lithium oxide (Li2O), lithium peroxide (Li2O2),
lithium hydroxide (LiOH), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), and lithium nitride
(Li3N). Specifically, we demonstrate that BE separations between core levels
present in a particular phase (e.g. BE separation between the O 1s and Li 1s
core levels in Li2O) provide an additional constraint that can significantly
improve reliability of phase identification. Finally, as an exemplary case we
apply the charge-correction methodology to XPS data acquired from a symmetric
cell based on a Li2S P2S5 solid electrolyte. This analysis demonstrates that
accurately accounting for XPS BE shifts as a function of current-bias
conditions can provide a direct probe of ionic conductivities associated with
battery materials.

  second-harmonic generation","  Quadratic optical parametric processes form the foundation for a variety of
applications related to classical and quantum frequency conversion, which have
attracted significant interest recently in on-chip implementation. These
processes rely on phase matching among the interacting guided modes, and
refractive index engineering has been a primary approach for this purpose.
Unfortunately, the modal phase matching approaches developed so far only
produce parametric generation with fairly low efficiencies, due to the
intrinsic modal mismatch of spatial symmetries. Here we propose a universal
design and operation principle for highly efficient optical parametric
generation on integrated photonic platforms. By introducing spatial symmetry
breaking into the optical nonlinearity of the device, we are able to
dramatically enhance the nonlinear parametric interaction to realize an
extremely high efficiency. We employ this approach to design and fabricate a
heterogeneous titanium oxide/lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that is
able to offer second-harmonic generation with a theoretical conversion
efficiency as high as 2900% W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which enables us to
experimentally achieve a conversion efficiency of 36.0% W$^{-1}$ in a waveguide
only 2.35 mm long, corresponding to a recorded normalized efficiency of 650%
W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ that is significantly beyond the reach of conventional modal
phase matching approaches. Unlike nonlinearity domain engineering that is
material selective, the proposed operation principle can be flexibly applied to
any other on-chip quadratic nonlinear platform to support ultra-highly
efficient optical parametric interactions, thus opening up a great avenue
towards extreme nonlinear and quantum optics with great potentials for broad
applications in energy efficient nonlinear and quantum photonic signal
processing.

components and are essential tools for optical communications and for precision
metrology, timing and spectroscopy. To date, wide-spanning combs are most often
generated by mode-locked lasers or dispersion-engineered resonators with
third-order Kerr nonlinearity. An alternative comb generation method uses
electro-optic (EO) phase modulation in a resonator with strong second-order
nonlinearity, resulting in combs with excellent stability and controllability.
Previous EO combs, however, have been limited to narrow widths by a weak EO
interaction strength and a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space
systems. In this work, we overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated
EO comb generator in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that
features a large electro-optic response, ultra-low optical loss and highly
co-localized microwave and optical felds, while enabling dispersion
engineering. Our measured EO frequency comb spans more than the entire
telecommunications L-band (over 900 comb lines spaced at ~ 10 GHz), and we show
that future dispersion engineering can enable octave-spanning combs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to
modulation frequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable over
seven orders of magnitude (10 Hz to 100 MHz), and utilize this feature to
generate dual frequency combs in a single resonator. Our results show that
integrated EO comb generators, capable of generating wide and stable comb
spectra, are a powerful complement to integrated Kerr combs, enabling
applications ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the technological limitations of

the effect of waveguide imperfections on quantum state generation and

dispersion properties and suggest different possible strategies to reduce the

promising candidate, but it turns out to be too inert to interact with Li.
Here, by using the first-principles calculations, we predict that Germanium

concentration, which corresponds to the chemical formula C17Ge, the specific

than graphite. We show that the material is conductive before and after Li
adsorption. We also investigate the diffusion process of Li on Germagraphene,
and find that the diffusion barrier is low (~0.151 eV), implying fast Li
diffusion. The calculated average intercalation potential is very low (~0.03
V), which is beneficial for increasing the working voltage for the full-cells.
In addition, during the process of Li intercalation, the lattice change for the
material is quite small (~0.48%), implying good cycle performance. These
results suggest that Germagraphene could be a promising high-capacity anode

  graphene","  Recent experimental studies confirmed that a long searched conventional
superconducting phase in graphene can be induced via lithium deposition.
However, the canonical character of the lithium-decorated graphene (LiC$_{6}$)
superconductor postulated therein, as defined by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) theory, is ambiguous due to the moderate electron-phonon coupling
constant and low Fermi energy in this material. Herein, this issue is addressed
within the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism and beyond it via the first-order
electron-phonon vertex corrections, to account for the potentially pivotal
effects, hitherto not captured. The conducted analysis yields similar value of
the metal-superconductor transition temperature as in the previous studies
($T_{C} \sim 6$ K), yet for a weaker depairing electron correlations, which
magnitude in the non-adiabatic regime approaches predictions of the
Morel-Anderson model. Moreover, the characteristic ratio of the pairing gap and
the inverse temperature is found to notably exceeds estimates of the BCS
theory. In a results, it is argued that the superconducting state in LiC$_{6}$
may have non-canonical character strongly influenced by the non-adiabatic and
retardation effects. Moreover, discussed phase appears as a vital case study,
which suggests that other two-dimensional superconductors of hexagonal
structure may exhibit similar non-canonical behavior as LiC$_{6}$.

  Estimation in Electric Vehicles","  This paper presents a novel framework for state-of-charge estimation of
rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles using a two-stage nonlinear
estimator called the eXogenous Kalman filter (XKF). The nonlinear estimator
consists of a cascade of nonlinear observer (NLO) and linearized Kalman filter
(LKF). The NLO is used to produce a globally convergent auxiliary state
estimate that is used to generate a linearized model in the time-varying Kalman
filter algorithm. To demonstrate the proposed approach, we present a model of a
lithium-ion battery from an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The model has
linear process equations and a nonlinear output voltage equation. The method is
tested using experimental data of a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO$_4$) battery
under dynamic stress test (DST) and federal urban driving schedule (FUDS).
Effect on different ambient temperatures is also discussed. Compared with EKF
and UKF, our proposed XKF achieve faster convergence rate, which can be
attributed to the use of the NLO.

hardening of both the primary (proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, and the primary
component of nitrogen) and the secondary (anti-proton, lithium, beryllium,
boron and the secondary component of nitrogen) cosmic ray (CR) nuclei. With the
diffusion-reacceleration model, we consider two schemes to reproduce the
hardening in the spectra: (i) A high-rigidity break in primary source
injection; (ii) A high-rigidity break in diffusion coefficient. The global
fitting results show that both schemes could reproduce the spectra hardening in
current status. More precise multi-TV data (especially the data of secondary CR
species) is needed if one wants to distinguish these two schemes. In our global
fitting, each of the nuclei species is allocated an independent solar
modulation potential and a re-scale factor (which accounts for the isotopic
abundance for primary nuclei species and uncertainties of production cross
section or inhomogeneity of CR sources and propagation for secondary nuclei
species). The fitting values of these two parameter classes show us some hints
on some new directions in CR physics. All the fitted re-scale factors of
primary nuclei species have values that systematically smaller than 1.0, while
that of secondary nuclei species are systematically larger than 1.0. Moreover,
both the re-scale factor and solar modulation potential of beryllium have
values which are obviously different from other species. This might indicate
that beryllium has the specificity not only on its propagation in the
heliosphere, but also on its production cross section. All these new results
should be seriously studied in the future.

outburst of classical novae confirms the suggestion made in the 70s that novae
could make $^7$Li. We reconsidered the role of novae as producers of Li by
means of a detailed model of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. We showed
that novae could be the Galactic lithium source accounting for the observed
increase of Li abundances in the thin disk with stellar metallicity. The best
agreement with the upper envelope of the observed Li abundances is obtained for
a delay time of ~ 1 Gyr for the nova production and for an effective Li yield
of $1.8 (\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the whole nova life. Lithium
in halo stars is depleted by ~ 0.35 dex, assuming the pristine abundance from
standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We elaborate a model that matches the
pristine stellar abundances, assuming that all stars are depleted by 0.35 dex.
In this case, the delay remains the same, but the Li yields are doubled
compared to the previous case. This model also has the merit to match the Li
abundance in meteorites and young TTauri stars. The thick disk model, adopting
the parameters derived for the thin disk, can also explain the absence of
increase of Li abundances in its stars. The thick disk is old, but formed and
evolved in a time shorter than that required by novae to contribute
significantly to Li. Therefore, no Li enhancement is expected in thick disk
stars. We show that the almost constant Li abundance in the thick disk results
from the compensation of stellar astration by spallation processes.

use of methods such as cluster expansion (CE) is vital in enhancing our

catastrophic failure of Li metal batteries. However, the chemical component and
the atomic level structure of inactive Li have rarely been studied due to the
lack of effective diagnosis tools to accurately differentiate and quantify Li+
in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) components and the electrically isolated
unreacted metallic Li0, which together comprise the inactive Li. Here, by
introducing a new analytical method, Titration Gas Chromatography (TGC), we can
accurately quantify the contribution from metallic Li0 to the total amount of
inactive Li. We uncover that the Li0, rather than the electrochemically formed
SEI, dominates the inactive Li and capacity loss. Using cryogenic electron
microscopies to further study the microstructure and nanostructure of inactive
Li, we find that the Li0 is surrounded by insulating SEI, losing the electronic
conductive pathway to the bulk electrode. Coupling the measurements of the Li0
global content to observations of its local atomic structure, we reveal the
formation mechanism of inactive Li in different types of electrolytes, and
identify the true underlying cause of low Coulombic efficiency in Li metal
deposition and stripping. We ultimately propose strategies to enable the highly
efficient Li deposition and stripping to enable Li metal anode for next
generation high energy batteries.

  first-principles study","  In the context of novel solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries,
first-principles calculations are becoming increasingly more popular due to
their ability to reproduce and predict accurately the energy, structural, and
dynamical properties of fast-ion conductors. In order to accelerate the
discovery of new superionic conductors is convenient to establish meaningful
relations between ionic transport and simple materials descriptors. Recently,
several experimental studies on lithium fast-ion conductors have suggested a
correlation between lattice softness and enhanced ionic conductivity due to a
concomitant decrease in the activation energy for ion migration, $E_{a}$. In
this article, we employ extensive \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics
simulations based on density functional theory to substantiate the links
between ionic transport and lattice dynamics in a number of structurally and
chemically distinct lithium superionic conductors. Our first-principles results
show no evidence for a direct and general correlation between $E_{a}$, or the
hopping attempt frequency, and lattice softness. However, we find that, in
agreement with recent observations, the pre-exponential factor of lithium
diffusivity, $D_{0}$, follows the Meyer-Neldel rule $\propto
\exp{\left(E_{a}/\langle \omega \rangle\right)}$, where $\langle \omega
\rangle$ represents an average phonon frequency. Hence, lattice softness can be
identified with enhanced lithium diffusivity but only within families of
superionic materials presenting very similar migration activation energies, due
to larger $D_{0}$. On the technical side, we show that neglection of
temperature effects in first-principles estimation of $E_{a}$ may lead to huge
inaccuracies of $\sim 10$\%. The limitations of zero-temperature harmonic
approaches in modeling of lithium-ion conductors are also illustrated.

optimal functioning of Lithium-ion batteries. The Pseudo-Two Dimensional (P2D)
model is a very detailed electrochemical model suitable for simulations. On the
other side, its complexity prevents its usage in control and state estimation.
Therefore, it is more appropriate the use of simplified electrochemical models
such as the Single Particle Model with electrolyte dynamics (SPMe), which
exhibits good adherence to real data when suitably calibrated. This work
focuses on a Fisher-based optimal experimental design for identifying the SPMe

minimize the covariance parameters matrix. At first, the parameters are
estimated by considering the SPMe as the real plant. Subsequently, a more

$q_3$ is the three momentum transfer. With these three parameters we can model
the energy of final state electrons and nucleons for all available electron QE

coexistence of flat and dispersive energy bands, corresponding to localised and
delocalised electronic states. Electrons localise in orbitals spanning multiple
niobium sites in the plane of the blocks. Localised and delocalised electronic
states are both effectively one-dimensional and are partitioned between
different types of niobium sites. Flat bands associated with localised
electrons are present even at the GGA level, but a correct description of the
localisation requires the use of GGA+U or hybrid functionals. We discuss the
experimentally observed electrical and magnetic properties of niobium suboxides
in light of our results, and argue that their behaviour is similar to that of
$n$-doped semiconductors, but with a limited capacity for localised electrons.
When a threshold of one electron per block is exceeded, metallic electrons are
added to existing localised electrons. We propose that this behaviour of shear
phases is general for any type of $n$-doping, and should transfer to doping by
alkali metal (lithium) ions during operation of niobium oxide-based battery
electrodes. Future directions for theory and experiment on mixed-metal shear

cosmic-ray spectra. Low energy (< 0.25 GeV/n) cosmic-ray antiparticles such as
antideuterons are strong candidates for probing DM models, as the yield of
these particles from DM processes can exceed the astrophysical background by
more than two orders of magnitude. The General Antiparticle Spectrometer
(GAPS), a balloon borne cosmic-ray detector, will perform an ultra-low

approximately 1000 antiprotons in an unexplored energy range throughout one
long duration balloon (LDB) flight, which will constrain < 10 GeV DM models and
validate the GAPS detection technique. Unlike magnetic spectrometers, GAPS
relies on the formation of an exotic atom within the tracker in order to
identify antiparticles. The GAPS tracker consists of ten layers of
lithium-drifted silicon detectors which record dE/dx deposits from primary and
nuclear annihilation product tracks, as well as measure the energy of the
exotic atom deexcitation X-rays. A two-layer, plastic scintillator time of
flight (TOF) system surrounds the tracker and measures the particle velocity,
dE/dx deposits, and provides a fast trigger to the tracker. The nuclear
annihilation product multiplicity, deexcitation X-ray energies, TOF, and
stopping depth are all used together to discern between antiparticle species.
This presentation provided an overview of the GAPS experiment, an update on the
construction of the tracker and TOF systems, and a summary of the expected
performance of GAPS in light of the upcoming LDB flight from McMurdo Station,

nominally symmetric devices, with an electrolyte sandwiched between two
electrodes. Yet reversing the direction of current often provokes inordinate
formation of internal phases unanticipated from the phase diagram. For example,
internal oxygen bubbles form at the grain boundaries in the zirconia
electrolyte of SOEC4,7-10, thus implicating an oxygen pressure that is
impossibly high for the oxygen/hydrogen environments of the adjacent

similar Na metal islands were found in the Na-beta-alumina solid electrolytes

inordinate internal phase formation to a large overpotential that arises from
the need to overcome the kinetic bottlenecks in ion or electron transport.
Definite rules dictating the occurrence and absence of such phenomena are
provided to help predict and mitigate such phase formation, which leads to
microstructural instability, poor efficiency and premature failure.

meet the unique requirements of the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS)
experiment. GAPS is an Antarctic balloon-borne mission scheduled for the first
flight in late 2020. The GAPS experiment aims to survey low-energy cosmic-ray
antinuclei, particularly antideuterons, which are recognized as essentially
background-free signals from dark matter annihilation or decay. The GAPS Si(Li)
detector design is a thickness of 2.5 mm, diameter of 10 cm and 8 readout
strips. The energy resolution of <4 keV (FWHM) for 20 to 100 keV X-rays at
temperature of -35 to -45 C, far above the liquid nitrogen temperatures
frequently used to achieve fine energy resolution, is required. We developed a
high-quality Si crystal and Li-evaporation, diffusion and drift methods to form
a uniform Li-drifted layer. Guard ring structure and optimal etching of the
surface are confirmed to suppress the leakage current, which is a main source
of noise. We found a thin un-drifted layer retained on the p-side effectively
suppresses the leakage current. By these developments, we succeeded in
developing the GAPS Si(Li) detector. As the ultimate GAPS instrument will
require >1000 10-cm diameter Si(Li) detectors to achieve high sensitivity to
rare antideuteron events, high-yield production is also a key factor for the
success of the GAPS mission.

Experiments in Part I reveal nonlinear voltage dependence and strong
charge-discharge asymmetry in SEI growth on carbon black negative electrodes,
which is not captured by previous models. Here, we present a theoretical model
for the electrochemical kinetics of SEI growth coupled to lithium
intercalation, which accurately predicts experimental results with few

ion-electron conductor, and its electronic conductivity varies approximately
with the square of the local lithium concentration, consistent with hopping
conduction of electrons along percolating networks. By including a lithium-ion
concentration dependence for the electronic conductivity in the SEI, the bulk
SEI thus modulates the overpotential and exchange current of the electrolyte
reduction reaction. As a result, SEI growth is promoted during lithiation but
suppressed during delithiation. This new insight establishes the fundamental
electrochemistry of SEI growth kinetics. Our model improves upon existing

in many applications such as hybrid electric and electric vehicles, due to its
higher energy density and longer life cycle. For these applications, the
battery should perform reliably and pose no safety threats. However, the
performance of Li-ion batteries can be affected by abnormal thermal behaviors,
defined as faults. It is essential to develop reliable thermal management
system to accurately predict and monitor thermal behaviors of Li-ion battery.
Using the first-principle models of batteries, this work presents a stochastic
fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm to identify two particular faults
in the Li-ion battery cells, using easily measured quantities such as
temperatures. Models of Li-ion battery are typically derived from the
underlying physical phenomena. To make model tractable and useful, it is common
to make simplifications during model development, which may consequently
introduce mismatch between models and battery cells. Further, FDD algorithms
can be affected by uncertainty, which may originate from either intrinsic time
varying phenomena or model calibration with noisy data. A two-step FDD
algorithm is developed in this work to correct model of Li-ion battery cells
and to identify faulty operations from a normal operating condition. An
iterative optimization problem is proposed to correct the model by
incorporating the errors between measured quantities and model predictions,
which is followed by an optimization-based FDD to provide a probabilistic
description of the occurrence of possible faults, while taking the uncertainty
into account. The two-step stochastic FDD algorithm in this work is shown to be
efficient in terms of fault detection rate for both individual and simultaneous
faults in Li-ion batteries, as compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

M=Mo, W and X = S, Se) are known to undergo charge induced transitions from
semi-conducting H phases to metallic T phases. This occurs, for example, when
bulk TMDs are exfoliated with the aid of alkali ion intercalants. However, it
is difficult to experimentally decouple the effect of composition-dependent
phase transition barriers from indirect effects related to the exfoliation
process. Here, using first-principles calculations, we study the energetics of
transition between the different structural polytypes of four group-VI TMDs
upon lithium adsorption. We find that both the activation barrier from the H
phase to the metallic phase in charged monolayers and the reverse barrier in
neutral monolayers are required to explain experimental results. We show that
the high proportion of metallic phase found in WS$_2$ monolayers after alkali
treatment can be explained by high transition barriers to revert back to the H
phase once in a neutral state. The calculated barriers however cannot explain
the low proportion of metallic phase found in MoS$_2$ monolayers in some

breakthrough could also enable the control of heat flow using thermal circuits,
in a manner analogous to electronic circuits. Here we demonstrate switchable
thermal transistors with an order of magnitude thermal on/off ratio, based on
reversible electrochemical lithium intercalation in MoS2 thin films. We use
spatially-resolved time-domain thermoreflectance to map the lithium ion

the lithiated state correlates with increased thickness and surface roughness.
First principles calculations reveal that the thermal conductance modulation is

  Prevent Dendrite Formation in Lithium Metal Batteries","  Dendrite formation during electrodeposition while charging lithium metal
batteries compromises their safety. While high shear modulus solid-ion
conductors (SICs) have been prioritized to resolve pressure-driven
instabilities that lead to dendrite propagation and cell shorting, it is
unclear whether these or alternatives are needed to guide uniform lithium
electrodeposition, which is intrinsically density-driven. Here, we show that
SICs can be designed within a universal chemomechanical paradigm to access
either pressure-driven dendrite-blocking or density-driven dendrite-suppressing
properties, but not both. This dichotomy reflects the competing influence of
the SICs mechanical properties and partial molar volume of Li+ relative to
those of the lithium anode on plating outcomes. Within this paradigm, we
explore SICs in a previously unrecognized dendrite-suppressing regime that are
concomitantly soft, as is typical of polymer electrolytes, but feature
atypically low Li+ partial molar volume, more reminiscent of hard ceramics. Li
plating mediated by these SICs is uniform, as revealed using synchrotron hard
x-ray microtomography. As a result, cell cycle-life is extended, even when
assembled with thin Li anodes and high-voltage NMC-622 cathodes, where 20
percent of the Li inventory is reversibly cycled.

battery are estimated simultaneously, the estimation accuracy is hard to be
ensured due to uncertainties in the estimation process. To improve the
estimation performance a sequential algorithm, which uses frequency scale
separation and estimates parameters/states sequentially by injecting currents
with different frequencies, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, by
incorporating a high-pass filter, the parameters can be independently
characterized by injecting high-frequency and medium-frequency currents,
respectively. Using the estimated parameters, battery capacity and State of
Charge can then be estimated concurrently. Experimental results show that the
estimation accuracy of the proposed sequential algorithm is much better than
the concurrent algorithm where all parameters/states are estimated

However, a critical issue that limits their practical applications is the
confined motion of lithium atoms within their van der Waal's gaps, which is the
leading cause for battery failure due to severe clustering and phase
separation. Here we demonstrate that antimonene, an exfoliatable 2D material
with a high structural stability, exhibits a highly mobile cross-sheet motion
owing to its unique structural features. The advent of the vertically permeable
channels opens a new pathway of lithium besides the normal motion along the
basal plane, rendering a 2+1 dimensional kinetics. Specifically, our
first-principles calculations combined with the discrete geometry analysis
revealed that the energy barrier for a lithium atom to diffuse across the
antimonene sheet is as low as 0.36 eV, which can be further reduced to 0.18 eV
under a tensile strain of 4%. These ultralow diffusion barriers across the
sheet can open a new dimension for controlling the motion of lithium atoms,
leading to a new paradigm for high-performance lithium batteries or inorganic

investigate the effects that different battery types have on the optimal

resilience perspectives. Many industry reports, as well as research papers,
have already highlighted the crucial role that storage systems have in the
coming years in the electricity sector, especially when combined with renewable
energy systems (RES). Given the high cost of storage technologies, there is an
urgent need for optimizing such integrated energy systems. In this paper, a
simulation-based method is adopted and improved, in order to compare different
battery types based on their characteristics by considering projected trends in
the future. After the introduction of four different battery types, i.e.
lead-acid, sodium sulphur, vanadium redox and lithium-ion, the mathematical
model for the optimization problem is presented, along with the required
explanations. Subsequently, a case study is described and the numerical
assumptions are defined. Therein, our specific focus addresses the different
values that the four battery types possess in three critical parameters, i.e.
battery cost, efficiency and depth of discharge (DoD). Finally, results and
discussion are provided in an illustrative and informative way. This model
provides a useful guide for relevant future work in the area, and also serves
as a baseline for more comprehensive methodologies regarding optimal sizing of

496 (1963)) that the energy $E_{HF}$ of the Slater determinant (SlDet) $|\Phi
_{HF}\rangle$, obtained by the single particle Hartree-Fock (HF) equation, does
not coincide with the minimum energy of the functional $\langle\Phi|H|\Phi
\rangle$ where $|\Phi \rangle$ is a SlDet and $H$ is the many particle
Hamiltonian. However, in most textbooks, there is no mention of this fact. In
this paper, starting from a Slater determinant $|\Phi \rangle$ with its spin
orbitals calculated by the standard HF equation or other approximation, we
search for the maximum of the functional $|\langle\Phi ^{\prime }|H|\Phi
\rangle|$, where $|\Phi ^{\prime }\rangle$ is a SlDet and $H$ is the exact
Hamiltonian of an atom or a molecule. The element $|\langle\Phi _{1}|H|\Phi
\rangle|$ with $|\Phi _{1}\rangle$ the maximizing $|\Phi ^{\prime }\rangle$
gives a value larger than $\langle\Phi|H|\Phi\rangle$. The next step is to
calculate the corresponding maximum overlap $\langle\Phi_{2}|H|\Phi
_{1}\rangle|$ and subsequently $|\langle\Phi _{n+1}|H|\Phi _{n}\rangle|$ until
$|\langle\Phi _{m+1}|H|\Phi _{m}\rangle -\langle\Phi _{m-1}|H|\Phi

numerical accuracy. We show that the sequence $a_{n}=|\langle\Phi

procedure for determining the eigenstate energies of several configurations of
H$_{3}$, the Lithium atom, LiH and Be. After comparing our values with those of
the configuration interaction we found that our deviations are in the range
10$^{-5}~$to $10^{-8}$ and the ground state energy is significantly below that
of the standard HF calculations.

identification of candidate phases. We use ab initio random structure searching
(AIRSS) to identify competing phases and supplement the results with
calculations of vibrational properties and relevant derived neutron diffraction
patterns. Strong quantum nuclear effects are present, prompting a careful
treatment of vibrations. We directly map the Born-Oppenheimer surface of Li for
the first time, allowing the extension of the normal quasi-harmonic treatment
of vibrations to a ""quasi-anharmonic"" approach, where the effects of
anharmonicity are included. The Gibbs free energies of the FCC, BCC, HCP and 9R
phases are derived using a variety of equations of state. We find that the
anharmonic contribution to the Gibbs free energies of Li phases is of the same
order as the differences between phases. Anharmonicity also makes a noticeable
difference to the 0 K phonon dispersion of the BCC phase, with the largest
difference at the N-point phonon. The ordering of phase transitions that we
find agrees with the calculations of Ackland et al. [Science 356, 1254-1259,
(2017)], even when anharmonic effects are included, suggesting that a
quasi-harmonic treatment is sufficient for correct phase behaviour. We show
explicitly that the Martensitic phase transition from close-packed to BCC
lithium upon heating is driven by entropic contributions to the phonon free
energy.

The salient features of the PTF 14jg outburst are: (i) projected location near
the W4 HII region and radial velocity consistent with physical association;
(ii) a lightcurve that underwent a $\sim$6-7 mag optical (R-band) through
mid-infrared (L-band) brightening on a few month time scale, that peaked and
then faded by $\sim$3 mag, but plateaued still $>$3.5 mag above quiescence by
$\sim$8 months post-peak, lasting to at least five years after eruption; (iii)
strong outflow signatures, with velocities reaching -530 km/s; (iv) a low
gravity and broad ($\sim$100-150 km/s FWHM) optical absorption line spectrum
that systematically changes its spectral type with wavelength; (v) lithium; and
(vi) ultraviolet and infrared excess. We tentatively identify the outburst as
exhibiting characteristics of a young star FU Ori event. However, the burst
would be unusually hot, with an absorption spectrum exhibiting high-excitation
($\sim$11,000-15,000 K) lines in the optical, and no evidence of CO in the
near-infrared, in addition to exhibiting an unusual lightcurve. We thus also
consider alternative scenarios including various forms of novae, nuclear
burning instabilities, massive star events, and mergers -- finding them all
inferior to the atypically hot FU Ori star classification. The source
eventually may be interpreted as a new category of young star outburst with
larger amplitude and shorter rise time than most FU Ori-like events. Continued
monitoring of the lightcurve and spectral evolution will reveal its true
nature.

show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical
chemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the
metallicity-rotational velocity relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting
conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age
and/or birth radius. It is demonstrated that the MVR in RAVE giants is
consistent with being always strongly negative, when narrow bins of [Mg/Fe] are
considered. This is directly related to the negative radial metallicity
gradients of stars grouped by common age (mono-age populations) due to the
inside out disk formation. The effect of the asymmetric drift can then give
rise to a positive MVR trend in high-[alpha/Fe] stars, with a slope dependent
on a given survey's selection function and observational uncertainties. We also
study the variation of lithium abundance, A(Li), with [Fe/H] of AMBRE:HARPS
dwarfs. A strong reversal in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend of the total
sample is found for mono-age populations, flattening for younger groups of
stars. Dissecting by birth radius shows strengthening in the positive
A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend, shifting to higher [Fe/H] with decreasing birth radius;
these observational results suggest new constraints on chemical evolution
models. This work highlights the necessity for precise age estimates for large
stellar samples covering wide spatial regions.

  the solar vicinity","  We propose here that the lithium decrease at super-solar metallicities
observed in high resolution spectroscopic surveys can be explained by the
interplay of mixed populations, coming from the inner regions of the Milky Way
disc. The lower lithium content of these stars is a consequence of inside-out
disc formation, plus radial migration. In this framework, local stars with
super-solar metallicities would have migrated to the solar vicinity and
depleted their original lithium during their travel time. To arrive to such a
result, we took advantage of the AMBRE catalog of lithium abundances combined
with chemical evolution models which take into account the contribution to the
lithium enrichment by different nucleosynthetic sources. A large proportion of
migrated stars can explain the observed lower lithium abundance at super-solar
metallicities. We stress that nowadays, there is no stellar model able to
predict Li-depletion for such super-solar metallicity stars, and the Solar
Li-depletion has to be assumed. In addition, it currently exists no solid
quantitative estimate of the proportion of migrated stars in the Solar
neighborhood and their travel time. Our results illustrate how important it is
to properly include radial migration when comparing chemical evolution models
to observations, and that in this case, the lithium decrease at larger
metallicities does not necessarily imply that stellar yields have to be
modified, contrary to previous claims in literature.

photon frequency converter based on difference frequency generation (DFG). The
device converts 580 nm photons to 1541 nm using a strong pump laser at 930 nm,
in a periodically poled lithium niobate ridge waveguide. The converter reaches
a maximum device efficiency of 46 % (internal efficiency of 67 %) at a pump
power of 250 mW. The noise produced by the pump laser is investigated in detail
by recording the noise spectra both in the telecom and visible regimes, and
measuring the power dependence of the noise rates. The noise spectrum in the
telecom is very broadband, as expected from previous work on similar DFG
converters. However, we also observe several narrow dips in the telecom
spectrum, with corresponding peaks appearing in the 580 nm noise spectrum.
These features are explained by sum frequency generation of the telecom noise
at wavelengths given by the phase matching condition of different spatial modes
in the waveguide. The proposed noise model is in good agreement with all the
measured data, including the power-dependence of the noise rates, both in the
visible and telecom regime. These results are applicable to the class of DFG
converters where the pump laser wavelength is in between the input and target

  low-mass red giants","  Theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that most of the lithium
inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However,
observations reveal that about 1% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium,
often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the Big
Bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four
decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the
origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar
astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2,330 low-mass (1 to
3$\,M_\odot$) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with
internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary
companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning
cores ($80^{+7}_{-6}\%$), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises
with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may
explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have
helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations as the
primary mechanism for lithium-rich giants, including all stages related to
single star evolution. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for
only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion
timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a
binary companion.

  graphene walls","  We perform molecular dynamics simulations of ionic liquids confined between
graphene walls under a large variety of conditions (pure ionic liquids,
mixtures with water and alcohols, mixtures with lithium salts and defective
graphene walls). Our results show that the formation of striped and hexagonal
patterns in the Stern layer can be considered as a general feature of ionic
liquids at electrochemical interfaces, the transition between patterns being
controlled by the net balance of charge in the innermost layer of adsorbed
molecules. This explains previously reported experimental and computational
results and, for the first time, why these pattern changes are triggered by any
perturbation of the charge density at the innermost layer of the electric
double layer (voltage and composition changes, and vacancies at the electrode
walls, among others), which may help tuning electrode-ionic liquid interfaces.
Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that such structures can be reproduced by
a simple two-dimensional lattice model with only nearest-neighbour
interactions, governed by highly screened ionic interactions and short-range
and excluded volume interactions. We also show that the results of our
simulations are consistent with those inferred from the Landau-Brazovskii
theory of pattern formation in self-assembling systems. The presence of these
patterns at the ionic liquid graphene-electrode interfaces may have a strong
impact on the process of ionic transfer from the bulk mixtures to the
electrodes, on the differential capacitance of the electrode-electrolyte double
layer or on the rates of redox reactions at the electrodes, among other
physicochemical properties, and is therefore an effect of great technological
interest.

selectively dope monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2 and demonstrate that these
ferroelectric domains can significantly enhance or inhibit photoluminescence
(PL) with the most dramatic modulation occurring at the heterojunction
interface between two domains. A micro-PL and Raman system is used to obtain
spatially resolved images of the differently doped transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). The domain inverted lithium niobate causes changes in
the TMDs due to electrostatic doping as a result of the remnant polarization
from the substrate. Moreover, the differently doped TMDs (n-type MoSe2 and
p-type WSe2) exhibit opposite PL modulation. Distinct oppositely charged
domains were obtained with a 9-fold PL enhancement for the same single MoSe2
sheet when adhered to the positive (P+) and negative (P-) domains. This sharp
PL modulation on the ferroelectric domain results from different free electron
or hole concentrations in the materials conduction band or valence band.
Moreover, excitons dissociate rapidly at the interface between the P+ and P-
domains due to the built-in electric field. We are able to adjust the charge on
the P+ and P- domains using temperature via the pyroelectric effect and observe
rapid PL quenching over a narrow temperature range illustrating the observed PL
modulation is electronic in nature. This observation creates an opportunity to
harness the direct bandgap TMD 2D materials as an active optical component for
the lithium niobate platform using domain engineering of the lithium niobate
substrate to create optically active heterostructures that could be used for
photodetectors or even electrically driven optical sources on-chip.

of in-situ control of the photon emission wavelength and its optical
polarization properties. Here, we report on the dynamic control of the optical
emission from core-shell GaN/InGaN nanowire (NW) heterostructures using radio
frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The SAWs are excited on the surface of
a piezoelectric lithium niobate crystal equipped with a SAW delay line onto
which the NWs were mechanically transferred. Luminescent quantum dot (QD)-like
exciton localization centers induced by compositional fluctuations within the
InGaN nanoshell were identified using stroboscopic micro-photoluminescence
(micro-PL) spectroscopy. They exhibit narrow and almost fully linearly
polarized emission lines in the micro-PL spectra and a pronounced anti-bunching
signature of single photon emission in the photon correlation experiments. When
the nanowire is perturbed by the propagating SAW, the embedded QD is
periodically strained and its excitonic transitions are modulated by the
acousto-mechanical coupling, giving rise to a spectral fine-tuning within a
~1.5 meV bandwidth at the acoustic frequency of ~330 MHz. This outcome can be
further combined with spectral detection filtering for temporal control of the
emitted photons. The effect of the SAW piezoelectric field on the QD charge
population and on the optical polarization degree is also observed. The
advantage of the acousto-optoelectric over other control schemes is that it
allows in-situ manipulation of the optical emission properties over a wide
frequency range (up to GHz frequencies).

promising candidate for advanced photonic functions such as high-speed
modulation, nonlinear frequency conversion and frequency comb generation. For
practical applications, optical interfaces that feature low fiber-to-chip

dB) dominates the total insertion losses of typical LN photonic integrated
circuits, where on-chip propagation losses can be as low as 0.03 - 0.1 dB/cm.
Here we experimentally demonstrate a low-loss mode size converter for coupling
between a standard lensed fiber and sub-micrometer LN rib waveguides. The
coupler consists of two inverse tapers that convert the small optical mode of a
rib waveguide into a symmetric guided mode of a LN nanowire, featuring a larger
mode area matched to that of a tapered optical fiber. The measured
fiber-to-chip coupling loss is lower than 1.7 dB/facet with high fabrication
tolerance and repeatability. Our results open door for practical integrated LN

adsorption and diffusion of lithium in bilayer graphene (BLG) as anodes in
lithium-ion batteries. Based on energy barriers directly obtained from
first-principle calculations for single-Li and two-Li intercalated BLG, a new
equation was deduced for predicting energy barriers considering Li's
interactions for multi-Li intercalated BLG. Our calculated results indicate
that Li energetically prefers to intercalate within rather than adsorb outside
the bilayer graphene. Additionally, lithium exists in cationic state in the
bilayer graphene. More excitingly, ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient, within
AB-stacked BLG near room temperature was obtained, which reproduces the
ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient measured in recent experiment. However,
ultrafast Li diffusion was not found within AA-stacked BLG near room
temperature. The analyses of potential distribution indicate that the stacking
structure of BLG greatly affects its height of potential well within BLG, which
directly leads to the large difference in Li diffusion. Furthermore, it is
found that both the interaction among Li ions and the stacking, structure cause
Li diffusion within AB-stacked BLG to exhibit directional preference. Finally,
the temperature dependence of Li diffusion is described by the Arrhenius law.
These findings suggest that the stacking structure of BLG has an important
influence on Li diffusion within BLG, and changing the stacking structure of
BLG is one possible way to greatly improve Li diffusion rate within BLG. At
last, it is suggested that AB-stacked BLG can be an excellent candidate for
anode material in Lithium-ion batteries.

Simulations show that a thicker oxide layer reduces the waveguide loss but
lowers the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the SAW device. Optical
racetrack resonators with different lengths were fabricated by argon plasma
etching to experimentally extract waveguide losses. By increasing the thickness
of the oxide layer from 1 {\mu}m to 2 {\mu}m, propagation loss of 2 {\mu}m (1

to significantly reduce propagation loss due to leakage into the substrate and
simultaneously attain good electromechanical coupling in acoustic devices. This
work not only provides insights on the design and realization of low-loss
photonic waveguides in lithium niobate, but most importantly offers

battery state of health plays an extremely important role in guaranteeing

(AUV) is built to do mapping-type missions of seabeds as well as survey
missions. These missions require a great deal of power to reach underwater
depths (i.e. 3000 meters). The MUN Explorer uses 11 rechargeable Lithium-ion
(Li-ion) batteries as the main power source with a total capacity of 14.6kWh to
17.952kWh, and the vehicle can run for 10 hours. The draw-backs of operating
the existing power system of the MUN Explorer, which was done by the researcher
at the Holyrood management facility, include mobilization costs, logistics and
transport, and facility access, all of which should be taken into
consideration. Recharging the batteries for at least 8 hours is also very
challenging and time consuming. To overcome these challenges and run the MUN
Explorer for a long time, it is essential to integrate a fuel cell into an
existing power system (i.e. battery bank). The integration of the fuel cell not
only will increase the system power, but it will also reduce the number of
batteries needed as suggested by HOMER software. In this paper, an integrated
fuel cell is designed to be added into the MUN Explorer AUV along with a
battery bank system to increase its power system. The system sizing is
performed using HOMER software. The results from HOMER software show that a 1kW

surprisingly rich phase diagram under pressure, taking up several structures
with reduced symmetry, low coordination numbers, and even semiconducting
character with increasing density. Using first-principles calculations, we
demonstrate that some predicted high-pressure phases of elemental Li also host
topological electronic structures. Beginning at 80 GPa and coincident with a
transition to the Pbca phase, we find Li to be a Dirac nodal line semimetal. We
further calculate that Li retains linearly-dispersive energy bands in
subsequent predicted higher pressure phases, and that it exhibits a Lifshitz
transition between two Cmca phases at 220 GPa. The Fd-3m phase at 500 GPa forms
buckled honeycomb layers that give rise to a Dirac crossing 1 eV below the
Fermi energy. The well-isolated topological nodes near the Fermi level in these
phases result from increasing p-orbital character with density at the Fermi
level, itself a consequence of rising 1s core wavefunction overlap, and a
preference for nonsymmorphic symmetries in the crystal structures favored at
these pressures. Our results provide evidence that under pressure, bulk 3D
materials with light elements, or even pure elemental systems, can undergo
topological phase transitions hosting nontrivial topological properties near
the Fermi level with measurable consequences; and that, through pressure, we
can access these novel phases in elemental lithium.

Using the obtained ionization degree, we evaluate the magnetic field
diffusivity. We find that the field dissipation can be neglected for global
fields coherent over > a tenth of the cloud size as long as the field is not so
strong as to prohibit the collapse. With magnetic fields strong enough for
ambipolar diffusion heating to be significant, the magnetic pressure effects to
slow down the collapse and to reduce the compressional heating become more
important, and the temperature actually becomes lower than in the no-field
case.

temperature gradient and vice versa hence they can be used to harvest waste
heat into electricity and in thermal management applications. However, finding
highly efficient thermoelectrics with high figures of merit, zT$\geq$1, is very
challenging because the combination of high power factor and low thermal
conductivity is rare in materials. Here, we use first-principles methods to
analyze the thermoelectric properties of Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ ($X$=S,Se), a recently
synthesized class of lithium fast-ion conductors presenting high thermal
stability. In p-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, we estimate highly flat electronic valence
bands that render high Seebeck coefficients exceeding 400 ${\mu}$VK$^{-1}$ at
700K. In n-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, the electronic conduction bands are slightly
dispersive however the accompanying weak electron-acoustic phonon scattering
induces high electrical conductivity. The combination of high Seebeck
coefficient and electrical conductivity gives rise to high power factors,
reaching a maximum of 4 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ and 8
mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at 300 K. Likewise, the thermal
conductivity in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ is low as compared to conventional thermoelectric
materials, 2-5 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature. As a result, we estimate
a maximum zT = 1.05 in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ at 700 K and an extraordinary 3.07
(1.5) in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at the same temperature (300 K). Our findings of
huge zT in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ suggest that lithium fast-ion conductors, typically
employed as electrolytes in solid-state batteries, hold exceptional promise as
thermoelectric materials.

are not yet understood to a sufficient extent to fully realize the potential of
the incorporated materials. The vast majority of concurrent lithium ion
batteries make use of graphite anodes. Their working principle is based on
intercalation---the embedding and ordering of (lithium-) ions in the
two-dimensional spaces between the graphene sheets. This important process---it
yields the upper bound to a battery's charging speed and plays a decisive role
for its longevity---is characterized by multiple phase transitions, ordered and
disordered domains, as well as non-equilibrium phenomena, and therefore quite
complex. In this work, we provide a simulation framework for the purpose of
better understanding lithium intercalated graphite and its behaviour during use

more costly ab initio methods. We finally present structural properties and

First an Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) block is placed inside a re-entrant cavity
where the resulting hybrid mode is measured to be in the ultra strong coupling
regime. When fully hybridised the ratio between the coupling rate and uncoupled
mode frequencies is determined to be $g/\omega=0.46$. Next a thin YIG cylinder
is placed inside a loop gap cavity. The bright mode of this cavity couples to
the YIG sample and is similarly measured to be in the ultra strong coupling
regime with ratio of coupling rate to uncoupled mode frequencies as
$g/\omega=0.34$. A larger spin density medium such as lithium ferrite (LiFe) is
expected to improve couplings by a factor of 1.46 in both systems as coupling
strength is shown to be proportional to the square root of spin density and
magnetic moment. Such strongly coupled systems are potentially useful for
cavity QED, hybrid quantum systems and precision dark matter detection
experiments. The YIG disc in the loop gap cavity, is, in particular, shown to
be a strong candidate for dark matter detection. Finally, a LiFe sphere inside
a two post re-entrant cavity is considered. In past work it was shown that the
magnon mode in the sample has a turnover point in frequency. Additionally, it
was predicted that if the system was engineered such that it fully hybridised
at this turnover point the cavity-magnon polariton (CMP) transition frequency
would become insensitive to both first and second order magnetic bias field
fluctuations, a result useful for precision frequency applications. This work
implements such a system by engineering the cavity mode frequency to near this
turnover point, with suppression in sensitivity to second order bias magnetic
field fluctuations shown.

chemistry. In contrast to standard Monte Carlo, KMC permits the description of
time dependent dynamical processes and is not restricted to systems in
equilibrium. Recently KMC has been applied successfully in modelling of novel
energy materials such as Lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. We consider
general solid state systems which contain free, interacting particles which can
hop between localised sites in the material. The KMC transition rates for those
hops depend on the change in total potential energy of the system. For charged
particles this requires the frequent calculation of electrostatic interactions,
which is usually the bottleneck of the simulation. To avoid this issue and
obtain results in reasonable times, many studies replace the long-range
potential by a short range approximation. This, however, leads to systematic
errors and unphysical results. On the other hand standard electrostatic solvers
such as Ewald summation or fast Poisson solvers are highly inefficient or
introduce uncontrollable systematic errors at high resolution. In this paper we
describe how the Fast Multipole Method by Greengard and Rokhlin can be adapted
to overcome this issue by dramatically reducing computational costs. We exploit
the fact that each update in the transition rate calculation corresponds to a
single particle move and changes the configuration only by a small amount. This
allows us to construct an algorithm which scales linearly in the number of
charges for each KMC step, something which had not been deemed to be possible
before. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the method
by implementing it in a performance portable software library. We describe the
high-level Python interface of the code which makes it easy to adapt to
specific cases.

mechanically paves the way to significant advances in nanoscale heat
management. Using first-principles calculations we investigate the modulation
of heat transport in MoS2 by lithium intercalation and cross-plane strain. We
find that both the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity (kr, kz) of
MoS2 are extremely sensitive to both strain and electrochemical intercalation.
Combining lithium intercalation and strain, the in-plane and cross-plane
thermal conductivity can be tuned over one and two orders of magnitude,
respectively. Furthermore, since kr and kz respond in different ways to
intercalation and strain, the thermal conductivity anisotropy can be modulated
by two orders of magnitude. The underlying mechanisms for such large tunability
of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of \Mos are explored by computing and
analyzing the dispersion relations, group velocities, relaxation times and mean
free paths of phonons. Since both intercalation and strain can be applied
reversibly, their stark effect on thermal conductivity can be exploited to
design novel phononic devices, as well as for thermal management in MoS2-based

nitrogen atoms exhibit a large lifetime effect. Experimentally, this is
manifest as an apparent weakening of the x-ray emission signal from these
states, but a closer examination shows that instead it is due to extreme
broadening. This echos previous studies on ammonium nitrate, which, despite
large differences in the cation and space group, showed a similar effect
associated with the nitrate. Using first-principles $GW$ self-energy and
Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations we show that this effect is due in part to
short quasi-hole lifetimes for the orbitals constituting the NO $\sigma$ bonds.

rechargeable batteries can induce noticeable differences in the electrochemical
storage mechanisms of electrode materials. Many material parameters, such as
particle size, morphology, and the presence of defects, are known to further
affect the storage mechanism. Here, we report an investigation of how the
introduction of titanium vacancies into anatase TiO2 affects the sodium storage
mechanism. From pair distribution function analysis, we observe that sodium
ions are inserted into titanium vacancies at the early stage of the discharge
process. This is supported by density functional theory calculations, which
predict that sodium insertion is more favourable at vacancies than at
interstitial sites. Our calculations also show that the intercalation voltage
is sensitive to the anion coordination environment of the vacancy. Sodiation to
higher concentrations induces a phase transition toward a disordered
rhombohedral structure, similar to that observed in defect-free TiO2. Finally,
we find that the X-ray diffraction pattern of the rhombohedral phase
drastically changes depending on the composition and degree of disorder,
providing further comprehension on the sodium storage mechanism of anatase.

to study the core accretion theory of planets formation. These systems are
however, insufficiently studied. In this paper we present the main metallicity
and lithium abundance properties of these stars together with stars with only
debris discs and stars with only planets. Stars without detected planets nor
discs are also considered. The analysed sample is formed by main-sequence FGK
field single stars. Apart from the basic stellar parameters, we include the use
of dusty discs masses. The main results show for the first time that the dust
mass of debris disc stars with planets correlate with metallicity. We confirm
that these disc dust masses are related to their central stellar masses.
Separately, the masses of stars and those of planets also correlate with
metallicity. We conclude that two conditions are necessary to form giant
planets: to have a sufficient metallicity and also a sufficient protoplanetary
mass of gas and dust. The debris discs masses of stars without giant planets do
not correlate with metallicity, because they do not fulfil these two
conditions. Concerning lithium, by adopting a stellar model for lithium
depletion based on a strong interaction between the star and a protoplanetary
disc, we found that in agreement with the model predictions, observations
indicate that the main lithium depletion occurs during this initial
protoplanetary evolution stage. We show that the ultimately lithium depletion
is independent of the presence or absence of planets and appears to be only age
dependent.

Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, is computationally expensive to solve.
Typically simpler models, such as the single particle model (SPM), are used to
provide insight for control purposes. Recently, there has been a move to extend
the SPM to include electrolyte effects, which increase the accuracy and range
of applicability. However, these extended models are derived in an ad-hoc
manner, which leaves open the possibility that important terms may have been
neglected, resulting in the model not being as accurate as possible. In this
paper, we provide a systematic asymptotic derivation of both the SPM and a
correction term that accounts for the behaviour in the electrolyte. Firstly,
this allows us to quantify the error in the reduced model in terms of ratios of
key parameters in the model, from which the range of applicable operating
conditions can be determined. Secondly, in comparing our model with the ad-hoc
models from the literature, we show that previous models have neglected a key
set of terms. In particular, we make the crucial distinction between writing
the terminal voltage in pointwise and electrode-averaged form, which allows us
to gain additional accuracy whilst maintaining the same computational
complexity as the existing models.

chemo-mechanical polishing. The fabricated LNOI waveguides have a nearly
symmetric mode profile of a mode field size of ~2.5 micron (full-width at half
maximum). We develop a high-precision measurement approach by which the single
mode waveguides are characterized to have a propagation loss of ~0.042 dB/cm.

  chains - Peierls theorem revisited","  The onset of distortion in one-dimensional monatomic chains with partially
filled valence bands is considered to be well-established by the Peierls
theorem, which associates the distortion with the formation of a band gap and a
subsequent gain in energy. Employing modern total energy methods on the test
cases of lithium, sodium and carbon chains, we reveal that the distortion is
not universal, but conditional upon the balance between distorting and
stabilizing forces. Furthermore, in all systems studied, the electrostatic
interactions between the electrons and ions act as the main driving force for
distortion, rather than the electron band lowering at the Fermi level as is
commonly believed. The main stabilizing force which drives the chains toward
their symmetric arrangement is derived from the electronic kinetic energy. Both
forces are affected by the external conditions, e.g. stress, and consequently
the instability of one-dimensional nanowires is conditional upon them. This
brings a new perspective to the field of one-dimensional metals, and may shed
new light on the distortion of more complex structures.

  Crystallographic Shear Phases","  Wadsley--Roth crystallographic shear phases form a family of compounds that
have attracted attention due to their excellent performance as lithium-ion
battery electrodes. The complex crystallographic structure of these materials
poses a challenge for first-principles computational modelling and hinders the
understanding of their structural, electronic and dynamic properties. In this
article, we study three different niobium-tungsten oxide crystallographic shear
phases (Nb$_{12}$WO$_{33}$, Nb$_{14}$W$_{3}$O$_{44}$, Nb$_{16}$W$_5$O$_{55}$)
using an enumeration-based approach and first-principles density-functional
theory calculations. We report common principles governing the cation disorder,
lithium insertion mechanism, and electronic structure of these materials.
Tungsten preferentially occupies tetrahedral and block-central sites within the
block-type crystal structures. The lithium insertion proceeds via a three-step
mechanism, associated with an anisotropic evolution of the host lattice. Our
calculations reveal an important connection between long-range and local
structural changes: in the second step of the mechanism, the removal of local
structural distortions leads to the contraction of the lattice along specific
crystallographic directions, buffering the volume expansion of the material.
Niobium-tungsten oxide shear structures host small amounts of localised
electrons during initial lithium insertion due to the confining effect of the
blocks, but quickly become metallic upon further lithiation. We argue that the
combination of local, long-range, and electronic structural evolution over the
course of lithiation is beneficial to the performance of these materials as
battery electrodes. The mechanistic principles we establish arise from the
compound-independent crystallographic shear structure, and are therefore likely
to apply to Ti/Nb oxide or pure Nb oxide shear phases.

  high operating temperatures","  This study presents a fabrication process for lithium-drifted silicon
(Si(Li)) detectors that, compared to previous methods, allows for mass
production at a higher yield, while providing a large sensitive area and low
leakage currents at relatively high temperatures. This design, developed for
the unique requirements of the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS)
experiment, has an overall diameter of 10 cm, with ~9 cm of active area
segmented into 8 readout strips, and an overall thickness of 2.5 mm, with
$\gtrsim$2.2 mm ($\gtrsim$90%) sensitive thickness. An energy resolution
$\lesssim$4 keV full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for 20-100 keV X-rays is
required at the operating temperature ~-40C, which is far above the liquid
nitrogen temperatures conventionally used to achieve fine energy resolution.
High-yield production is also required for GAPS, which consists of
$\gtrsim$1000 detectors. Our specially-developed Si crystal and custom methods
of Li evaporation, diffusion and drifting allow for a thick, large-area and
uniform sensitive layer. We find that retaining a thin undrifted layer on the
p-side of the detector drastically reduces the leakage current, which is a
dominant component of the energy resolution at these temperatures. A guard-ring
structure and optimal etching of the detector surface are also confirmed to
suppress the leakage current. We report on the mass production of these
detectors that is ongoing now, and demonstrate it is capable of delivering a
high yield of ~90%.

  Fabrication","  Purpose-This paper is based on design of a quadruped robot and manufacturing
it with 3-D printer followed by its detailed analysis. It focuses on the
advantages of additive manufacturing rather than conventional manufacturing
techniques and also highlights its limitations. The consequences of choice of
different materials for 3-D printing are evaluated in this report.
Design/methodology/Approach- The parts were designed in CAD software and made
into Stereo lithography files, which were fed into the 3-D printing software.
They were printed with the selection of ABS material. Low torque servos were
employed in the beginning of the assembly and were controlled with the Arduino
Uno micro controller. Findings- The versatility of legged robots require
materials with high strength to weight ratio, where 3003 aluminium alloy sheets
proved to be a better choice than conventional ABS. The ABS legs buckled under
load and proved to be an inferior material choice for fabrication. The
aluminium sheet fabricated legs not only imparted structural stability to the
robot but also allowed in selection of more powerful servos for added
strength.The bot could now achieve significant level of stability. Research
Limitations/Implications- The power supply used for powering the bot was of
SMPS type of power supply which made it less mobile. Due to the huge demand of
current by the high torque servos used later, the power supply became a huge
limitation which can be overcome by applying Lithium ion batteries. Practical
Implications- The bot can be used for SLAM and autonomous navigation in areas
where it is almost impossible for humans to access into. Originality/Value-
This paper shows a concrete study on efficacy of quick CAD designing and rapid
fabrication.

Galactic stellar surveys. We consider detailed chemical evolution models for
the Milky Way halo, discs and bulge, and we compare our model predictions with
the most recent spectroscopic data for these different Galactic components. In
particular, we focus on the decrease of lithium at high metallicity observed by
the AMBRE Project, the Gaia-ESO Survey, and other spectroscopic surveys, which
still remains unexplained by theoretical models. We analyse the various lithium
producers and confirm that novae are the main source of lithium in the Galaxy,
in agreement with other previous studies. Moreover, we show that, by assuming
that the fraction of binary systems giving rise to novae is lower at higher
metallicity, we can suggest a novel explanation to the lithium decline at
super-solar metallicities: the above assumption is based on independent
constraints on the nova system birthrate, that have been recently proposed in
the literature. As regards to the thick disc, it is less lithium enhanced due
to the shorter timescale of formation and higher star formation efficiency with
respect to the thin disc and, therefore, we have a faster evolution and the
""reverse knee"" in the A(Li) vs. [Fe/H] relation is shifted towards higher
metallicities. Finally, we present our predictions about lithium evolution in
the Galactic bulge, that, however, still need further data to be confirmed or

to compare and study the composition and structure of the different phases that

cerimetric analysis revealed serious deviations, showing differences in the
degree of delithiation to the average degree of oxidation. A structural

recording the resulting phasematching spectra, the fabrication error present in

fit well with theoretical expectations and from the measured imperfection

first is based on volume averaging the electrode microstructure whereas the
second is based on the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) approach which treats the
electrode as a collection of spherical particles. A scaling analysis is used to
reduce the volume-averaged model and show that the electrochemical reactions
are the dominant source of heat. Matched asymptotic expansions are used to
compute solutions of the volume-averaged model for the cases of constant
applied current, oscillating applied current, and constant cell potential. The
asymptotic and numerical solutions of the volume-averaged model are in
remarkable agreement with numerical solutions of the thermal P2D model for

Homogenisation is then used to derive a thermal model for a battery consisting
of several connected lithium-ion cells. Despite accounting for the Arrhenius
dependence of the reaction coefficients, we show that thermal runaway does not
occur in the model. Instead, the cell potential is simply pushed closer to the
open-circuit potential. We also show that in many cases, the homogenised
battery model can be solved analytically, making it ideal for use in on-board
thermal management systems.

crystal coated with silver backing, which exhibits a solar absorptance of 4.7%
and nearly ideal infrared selectivity with high emission exactly within the
atmospheric transmission band (i.e., 8-13 um). Excellent daytime cooling
performance was demonstrated in an outdoor test with stagnation temperature
below the ambient temperature by 5 K under solar irradiance above 900 W/m2 and
a net cooling power of about 60 W/m2 when the cooler is in thermal equilibrium
with the ambient. As a bulk material with the highest ultraviolet-visible-near
infrared transmittance, lithium fluoride crystal has been widely employed as
the optical windows and mirrors in various applications. The proposed simple
selective infrared emitter based on lithium fluoride would open up an
innovative way to radiatively cool optical systems.

lithium-drifted silicon (Si(Li)) detectors. The TOF is a plastic scintillator
system that will both trigger the Si(Li) tracker and enable better
reconstruction of particle tracks. After coming to rest in the tracker,
antinuclei will form an excited exotic atom. This will then de-excite via
characteristic X-ray transitions before producing a pion/proton star when the
antiparticle annihilates with the nucleus. This unique event topology will give
GAPS the nearly background-free detection capability required for a rare-event
search.
  Here we present the scientific motivation for the GAPS experiment, its design
and its current status as it prepares for flight in the austral summer of
2021-22.

room temperature multiferroic nanocomposite comprised of an ordered

  helium glitch signature","  Recent developments in asteroseismology -- thanks to space-based missions
such as {\it CoRoT} and {\it Kepler} -- provide handles on those properties of
stars that were either completely inaccessible in the past or only poorly
measured. Among several such properties is the surface helium abundance of F
and G stars. We used the oscillatory signature introduced by the ionization of
helium in the observed oscillation frequencies to constrain the amount of
helium settling in F stars. For this purpose, we identified three promising F
stars for which the standard models of atomic diffusion predict large settling
(or complete depletion) of surface helium. Assuming turbulence at the base of
envelope convection zone slows down settling of the helium and heavy elements,
we found an envelope mixed mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-4}$M$_\odot$
necessary to reproduce the observed amplitude of helium signature for all the
three stars. This is much larger than the mixed mass of the order of
$10^{-6}$M$_\odot$ found in the previous studies performed using the
measurements of the heavy element abundances. This demonstrates the potential
of using the helium signature together with measurements of the heavy element
abundances to identify the most important physical processes competing against
atomic diffusion, allowing eventually to correctly interpret the observed
surface abundances of hot stars, consistent use of atomic diffusion in
modelling both hot and cool stars, and shed some light on the long-standing
cosmological lithium problem.

adatoms modify the conductivity of graphene significantly, as extra carriers
enhance conductivity while Coulomb scattering off the adatoms suppresses it.
However, conductivity probes the overall scattering rate, so a dominant channel
associated with long-range Coulomb scattering will mask weaker short-range
channels. We present weak localization measurements of epitaxial graphene with
lithium adatoms that separately quantify intra- and intervalley scattering
rates, then compare the measurements to tight-binding calculations of expected
rates for this system. The intravalley rate is strongly enhanced by Li
deposition, consistent with Coulomb scattering off the Li adatoms. A
simultaneous enhancement of intervalley scattering is partially explained by
extra carriers in the graphene interacting with residual disorder. But
differences between measured and calculated rates at high Li coverage may
indicate adatom-induced modifications to the band structure that go beyond the
applied model. Similar adatom-induced modifications of the graphene bands have
recently been observed in ARPES, but a full theoretical understanding of these

of metal-poor stars in the galactic halo. However, the observationally inferred
abundance remains at about a factor of three below the abundance predicted by
standard big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The resolution of this dilemma can be
either astrophysical (stars destroy lithium after BBN), nuclear (reactions
destroy lithium during BBN), or cosmological, i.e. new physics beyond the
standard BBN is responsible for destroying lithium. Here, we overview a variety
of possible cosmological solutions, and their shortcomings. On the one hand, we
examine the possibility of physical processes that modify the velocity
distribution of particles from the usually assumed Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics. A physical justification for this is an inhomogeneous spatial
distribution of domains of primordial magnetic field strength as a means to
reduce the primordial lithium abundance. Another possibility is that scattering
with the mildly relativistic electrons in the background plasma alters the
baryon distribution to one resembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution. We show that
neither of these possibilities can adequately resolve the lithium problem. A
number of alternate hybrid models are discussed including a mix of neutrino
degeneracy, unified dark matter, axion cooling, and the presence of decaying

shows that the previously neglected nanoscale composition of the polymer
electrolyte close to the electrode surface has an important effect on impedance
measurements, despite its negligible extent compared to the bulk electrolyte.
Using standard stainless steel blocking electrodes, the impedance of lithium
salt-doped poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (ISO) exhibited a marked
decrease upon thermal processing of the electrolyte. In contrast, covering the
electrode surface with a low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) brush
resulted in higher and more reproducible conductivity values, which were
insensitive to the thermal history of the device. A qualitative model of this
effect is based on the hypothesis that ISO surface reconstruction at the
different electrode surfaces leads to a change in the electrostatic double
layer, affecting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. As a main
result, PEO-brush modification of electrode surfaces is beneficial for the
robust electrolyte performance of PEO-containing block-copolymers and may be
crucial for their accurate characterization and use in Li-ion batteries.

the detection of photons is technically challenging: sample information is
gained in the spectral region of interest and transferred via entanglement into
another spectral range, for which highly sensitive detectors are available.
This is especially beneficial for terahertz radiation, as the corresponding
photon energy lies in the range of a few meV - an energy where no semiconductor
detectors are available and coherent detection schemes or cryogenically cooled
bolometers have to be employed. Here, we report on the first demonstration of
quantum sensing in the terahertz frequency range in which the terahertz photons
interact with a sample in free space and information about the sample thickness
is obtained by the detection of visible photons. A nonlinear single-crystal
interferometer setup with a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal (PPLN)
and a 660 nm pump source is used, generating visible (signal) photons and
associated (idler) photons in the terahertz frequency range. Separation from
the pump photons and detection of the visible signal photons is achieved by
using highly efficient and narrowband volume Bragg gratings and an uncooled
scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. The acquired
frequency-angular spectra show quantum interference in the Stokes as well as
the Anti-Stokes part of collinear forward generation caused by spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and down-conversion as well as up-conversion
of thermal photons. The information encoded in the quantum interference can be
used to determine the thickness of coatings or functional layers that are
mainly transparent in the terahertz spectral range. As a first demonstration,
we show layer thickness measurements with terahertz photons based on induced
coherence without induced emission.

in medicine, imaging, spectroscopy, characterization and manipulation of
condensed matter, and could support the development of next-generation compact
laser-based accelerators with applications in electron microscopy, ultrafast
X-ray sources and sub-femtosecond longitudinal diagnostics. Multicycle
THz-radiation can be generated by shooting an appropriate laser through a
periodically poled nonlinear crystal, e.g. lithium niobate (PPLN).
Unfortunately, the manufacturing processes of PPLNs require substantially
strong electric fields $\mathcal{O}(10~kV/mm)$ across the crystal width to
locally reverse the polarization domains; this limits the crystal apertures to
below 1 cm. Damage threshold limitations of lithium niobate thereby limits the
laser power which can be shone onto the crystal, which inherently limits the
production of high-power THz pulses. Here we show that in the THz regime, a
PPLN crystal can be mechanically constructed in-air by stacking lithium niobate
wafers together with 180$^{\circ}$ rotations to each other. The relatively long
(mm) wavelengths of the generated THz radiation compared to the small gaps
($\sim$10 $\mu$m) between wafers supports a near-ideal THz transmission between
wafers. We demonstrate the concept using a Joule-class laser system with
$\sim$50 mm diameter wafers and measure up to 1.3 mJ of THz radiation
corresponding to a peak power of $\sim$35 MW, a 50 times increase in THz power
compared to previous demonstrations. Our results indicate that high-power THz
radiation can be produced with existing and future high-power lasers in a
scalable way, setting a course toward multi-gigawatt THz pulses. Moreover the
simplicity of the scheme provides a simple way to synthesize waveforms for a
variety of applications.

highly flammable liquid electrolyte impedes the further development of
next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently, researchers reported the use
of electrospun core-shell fiber as the battery separator consisting of polymer

of a typical battery shorting, the protective polymer shell melts during
thermal-runaway and the flame retardants inside would be released to suppress

weight ratio of flame retardants is limited and dependent. Herein, we developed
a dual-nozzle, coaxial electrospinning approach to fabricate the core-shell
nanofiber with a greatly enhanced flame retardants weight percentage in the
final fibers. The weight ratio of flame retardants of triphenyl phosphate in
the final composite reaches over 60 wt.%. The LiFePO4-based cell using this

the computational cost of nonlinear MPC grows significantly with the complexity
of the underlying model, a sensitivity-based MPC (sMPC) is proposed, in which
the model adopted is obtained by linearizing the dynamics along a nominal
trajectory that is updated over time. The resulting sMPC optimizations are
quadratic programs which can be solved in real-time even for large battery

convenient route to tune the comb line spacing. However, excitation of a PSC is
generally stochastic by its nature and accessing a certain PSC state requires
delicate tuning procedure. Here we demonstrate the on-demand generation of PSCs

to produce a variety of PCSs and to switch between different PSC states,
deterministically and repetitively. We utilize the device to show arbitrary

of the resonator. The demonstration of PCSs on demand may now open up a great
avenue for flexibly controlling the repetition rate of soliton pulses, which

limited by poor stability and were confined to the 1.55 um wavelength range. In
this work, we describe a novel CR-OCT architecture that is free from these

economically viable, straightforward and cost effective techniques need to be
developed to separate the individual materials in a composite electrode.
Ultrasonic separation might be such a technique, provided that lithium ion
battery microparticles respond predictably to a sound field. Lithium ion
battery cathodes contain hydrophobic carbon. Owing to the incompressibility of
a solid, the thin gaseous layer surrounding these hydrophobic particles must
oscillate asymmetrically, when subjected to ultrasound. Consequently, the
harmonic content of the ultrasound signal radiated from hydrophobic
microparticles must be higher than that from hydrophilic microparticles with
the same size. The question of whether the harmonic signal response generated
by physical hydrophobic microparticles present in lithium ion battery cathodes
is higher than the harmonic response of other component materials in the
cathode is the focus of this paper. The scattering response of cathode
materials subjected to 1-MHz ultrasound was measured and compared. The cathode
materials C65, PVDF, and NMC respond differently to 1-MHz ultrasound. The
superharmonic response of C65 has been attributed to asymmetric oscillations

stars. We have taken high-resolution spectra with Keck I with HIRES to
determine Be abundances along the subgiant branch of M 67, where there are
dramatic depletions of Li. These subgiants range in mass from 1.26 to 1.32
M$_{\odot}$ and have evolved from main-sequence stars that would have occupied
the region of the Li-Be dip found in younger clusters. Lithium abundances have
been adjusted to the same scale for 103 stars in M 67 by Pace et al. The more
massive stars $-$ now the coolest and furthest-evolved from the main-sequence

abundances also show a decline, but by a factor of $\sim$50. The two elements
decline together with Li showing a steeper decline in these subgiants than it
does in the Li-Be dip stars. The relative decline in Be abundance compared to
Li is remarkably well fit by the models of Sills & Deliyannis, made

processes occurring in stellar interiors. We present the results of a new large
Lithium survey in red giant stars and combine it with surveys from the
literature to probe the impact of rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline
double-diffusive instability along stellar evolution. We determined the surface
Li abundance for a sample of 829 giant stars with accurate Gaia parallaxes for
a large sub-sample (810 stars) complemented with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes
(19 stars). The spectra of our sample of northern and southern giant stars were
obtained in three ground-based observatories (OHP, ESO-La Silla, Mc Donald). We
determined the atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H]), and the Li
abundance. We used Gaia parallaxes and photometry to determine the luminosity
of our objects and we estimated the mass and evolution status of each sample
star with a maximum-likelihood technique using stellar evolution models
computed with the STAREVOL code. We compared the observed Li behaviour with
predictions from stellar models, including rotation and thermohaline mixing.
The same approach was used for stars from selected Li surveys from the
literature. Rotation-induced mixing accounts nicely for the lithium behaviour
in stars warmer than about 4200K, independently of the mass domain. For stars
with masses lower than 2Msun thermohaline mixing leads to further Li depletion
below the Teff of the RGB bump (about 4000K), and on the early AGB, as
observed. Depending on the definition we adopt, we find between 0.8 and 2.2% of
Li-rich giants in our new sample. Gaia puts a new spin on the understanding of
mixing processes in stars, and our study confirms the importance of
rotation-induced processes and of thermohaline mixing. However asteroseismology
is required to definitively pinpoint the actual evolution status of Li-rich
giants.

  phase for highly reversible lithium metal anode","  Lithium metal batteries (LMB) are vital devices for high-energy-density
energy storage, but Li metal anode is highly reactive with electrolyte and
forms uncontrolled dendrite that can cause undesirable parasitic reactions thus
poor cycling stability and raise safety concerns. Despite remarkable progress
made to partly solve these issues, the Li metal still plate at the
electrode/electrolyte interface where the parasitic reactions and dendrite
formation invariably occur. Here we demonstrate the inward-growth plating of Li
into a metal foil while avoiding surface deposition, which is driven by the
reversible solid-solution based alloy phase change. Lithiation of the solid
solution alloy phase facilitates the freshly generated Li atoms at the surface
to sink into the foil, while the reversible alloy phase change is companied by
the dealloying reaction during delithiation, which extracts Li atoms from
inside of the foil. The yielded dendrite free Li anode produces an enhanced
Coulombic efficiency of 99.5 plus or minus 0.2% with a reversible capacity of
1660 mA h $g^{-1}$ (3.3 mA h cm$^{-2}$).

recently risen to the forefront of chip-scale nonlinear optics research since
its demonstration as an ultralow-loss integrated photonics platform. Due to its
significant quadratic nonlinearity ($\chi^{(2)}$), LN inspires many important
applications such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), spontaneous parametric
down-conversion, and optical parametric oscillation. Here, we demonstrate
high-efficiency SHG in dual-resonant, periodically poled z-cut LN microrings,
where quasi-phase matching is realized by field-assisted domain engineering.
Meanwhile, dual-band operation is accessed by optimizing the coupling
conditions in fundamental and second-harmonic bands via a single pulley
waveguide. As a result, when pumping a periodically poled LN microring in the
low power regime at around 1617nm, an on-chip SHG efficiency of 250,000%/W is
achieved, a state-of-the-art value reported among current integrated photonics
platforms. An absolute conversion efficiency of 15% is recorded with a low pump
power of 115$\mu$W in the waveguide. Such periodically poled LN microrings also
present a versatile platform for other cavity-enhanced quasi-phase matched

solving the model accounting for the porous microstructure is computationally

However, these effective models are usually postulated ad hoc rather than
systematically upscaled from the microscale equations. We present an effective
thermal electrochemical model obtained using asymptotic homogenisation, which
includes the electrochemical model at the cell level coupled with a thermal

the microstructure, all of them incorporated in a systematic manner. We also

smaller clusters of stars, they exhibit signs of some chemical evolution. At
least for this reason, they are intermediate between open clusters and massive
objects such as nuclear clusters or compact galaxies. While some facts are well
established, the increasing amount of observational data are revealing a
complexity that has so far defied the attempts to interpret the whole data set
in a simple scenario. We review this topic focusing on the main observational
features of clusters in the Milky Way and its satellites. We find that most of
the observational facts related to the chemical evolution in globular clusters
are described as being primarily a function of the initial mass of the
clusters, tuned by further dependence on the metallicity - that mainly affects
specific aspects of the nucleosynthesis processes involved - and on the
environment, that likely determines the possibility of indepenedent chemical
evolution of the fragments or satellites, where the clusters form. We review
the impact of multiple populations on different regions of the colour-magnitude
diagram and underline the constraints related to the observed abundances of
lithium, to the cluster dynamics, and to the frequency of binaries in stars of
different chemical composition. We then re-consider the issues related to the
mass budget and the relation between globular cluster and field stars. Any
successful model of globular cluster formation should explain these facts.

GALPROP-predicted LIS as input to HelMod, which provides the modulated spectra

instantaneous electric field through the permanent dipoles, the molecular
potentials dynamically oscillate and so does the crossings between them. In
this paper, we consider rotating-vibrating diatomic molecules (2D description)
and reveal the interplay between the dissociating wave packet and the
dynamically fluctuating crossing seam located in the configuration space of the
molecules spanned by the R vibrational and $\theta$ rotational coordinates. Our
showcase example is the widely studied lithium-fluoride (LiF) molecule for
which the two lowest $\Sigma$ states are nonadiabatically coupled at an avoided

energetically close. Optical pumping of the system in the ground state thus
results in two dissociation channels: one indirect route via the AC in the
ground $\Sigma$ state and one direct path in the $\Pi$ state. We show that
applying THz control pulses with specific time delays relative to the pumping,
can significantly alter the population dynamics, as well as, the kinetic energy

electronic states are energetically well separated and is akin to extended
MS-CASPT2 (XMS-CASPT2) in case the underlying zeroth-order references are
near-degenerate. Our approach follows a recipe analogous to XMS-CASPT2 to
ensure approximate invariance under unitary transformations of the model states
and a dynamical weighting scheme to smoothly interpolate the Fock operator
between a state-specific and a state-average regime. The resulting extended
dynamically weighted CASPT2 (XDW-CASPT2) methodology possesses the most
desirable features of both MS-CASPT2 and XMS-CASPT2, i.e. the ability to
provide accurate transition energies and correctly describe avoided crossings
and conical intersections. The reliability of XDW-CASPT2 is assessed on a
number of molecular systems. First, we consider the dissociation of lithium
fluoride, highlighting the distinctive characteristics of the new approach.
Second, the invariance of the theory is investigated by studying the conical
intersection of the distorted allene molecule. Finally, the relative accuracy
in the calculation of vertical excitation energies is benchmarked on a set of
26 organic compounds. We found that XDW-CASPT2, albeit being only approximately
invariant, produces smooth potential energy surfaces around conical
intersections and avoided crossings, performing equally well to the strictly
invariant XMS-CASPT2 method. The accuracy of vertical transition energies is
almost identical to MS-CASPT2, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.01 to 0.02

reveal the strong dependence of the inelastic losses on the internal spin
states of both species and suppressed losses in stretched state configurations.
Increasing the magnetic field up to 800 G we further investigate the magnetic
field dependence of the collisional interactions. There, smoothly increasing
inelastic losses are observed towards higher fields. The combined knowledge of
both the magnetic field and the spin state dependence of the collisional losses
of this prototypical mixture system of non-S-state and S-state atoms provides a
significant step forward towards controllable impurity physics realized in the
Yb-Li ultracold system.

as novel alternatives to ionic liquids that are extensively used in synthesis
of innovative materials, metal processing, catalysis, etc. However, their usage
is limited, primarily because of the large viscosity and poor conductivity.
Therefore, an understanding of the molecular origin of these properties is
essential to improve their industrial applicability. Here, we present the
report of the nanoscopic diffusion mechanism of acetamide in a DES synthesized
with lithium perchlorate as studied using neutron scattering and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation techniques. Although, the acetamide based DES (ADES)
has remarkably lower freezing point compared to pure acetamide, the molecular
mobility is found to be enormously restricted in the former. MD simulation
indicates a diffusion model with two distinct processes, corresponding to, long
range jump diffusion and localised diffusion within a restricted volume. This
model is validated by analysis of neutron scattering data in both molten
acetamide and ADES. The long range diffusion process of acetamide is slower by
a factor of three in ADES in comparison with molten acetamide. MD simulation
reveals that the long range diffusion in ADES is restricted mainly due to the
formation of hydrogen bond mediated complexes between the ionic species of the
salt and acetamide molecules. Hence, the origin of higher viscosity observed in
ADES can be attributed to the complexation. The complex formation also explains
the inhibition of the crystallisation process while cooling and thereby results
in depression of the freezing point of ADES.

metal phase in lithium osmate, LiOsO$_3$, using first-principles calculations.
We demonstrate that the polar metal phase in LiOsO$_3$ can be controlled by
biaxial strain. Based on density functional calculations, we show that a
compressive biaxial strain enhances the stability of the polar $R3c$ phase. On
the other hand, a tensile biaxial strain favors the centrosymmetric
$R\overline{3}c$ structure. Thus, strain emerges as a promising control
parameter over polar metallicity in this material. We uncover a strain-driven
quantum phase transition under tensile strain, and highlight intriguing
properties that could emerge in the vicinity of this polar to non-polar metal
transition. We examine the effect of charge doping on the polar metal phase. By
means of electrostatic doping as well as supercell calculations, we find that
screening from additional charge carriers, expected to suppress the polar
distortions, have only a small effect on them. Rather remarkably, and in
contrast to conventional ferroelectrics, the polar metal phase in LiOsO$_3$
remains robust against charge doping up to large doping values.

are significantly impacted by uncertainty in the tail behavior of a
distribution. Uncertainty in the tail can take many different forms, each of
which leads to a particular ambiguity set of alternative models. Distributional
robustness bounds over such an ambiguity set constitute a stress-test of the
model. In this paper we develop a method, utilizing R\'enyi-divergences, of
constructing the ambiguity set that captures a user-specified form of
tail-perturbation. We then obtain distributional robustness bounds (performance
guarantees) for risk-sensitive QoIs over these ambiguity sets, using the known

We also expand on this connection in several ways, including a generalization
of the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula to R\'enyi divergences, and various
tightness results. These ideas are illustrated through applications to
uncertainty quantification in a model of lithium-ion battery failure,
robustness of large deviations rate functions, and risk-sensitive
distributionally robust optimization for option pricing.

electrode conductivity and rate-performance in
Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC) cathodes filled with various
quantities of carbon black, single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene. The
electrode conductivity is always extremely anisotropic with the out-of-plane
conductivity, which is most relevant to rate-performance, roughly 1000 smaller
than the in-plane conductivity. For all fillers the conductivity increases with
filler loading although the nanotube-filled electrodes show by far the most
rapid increase. Fitting capacity versus rate curves yielded the characteristic
time associated with charge/discharge. This parameter increased linearly with
the inverse of the out-of-plane conductivity, with all data points falling on
the same master curve. Using a simple mechanistic model for the characteristic
time, we develop an equation which matches the experimental data almost
perfectly with no adjustable parameters. This implies that increasing the
electrode conductivity improves the rate-performance by decreasing the RC
charging time of the electrode. This model shows the effect of electrode
resistance on the rate-performance to become negligible in almost all cases
once the out-of-plane conductivity of the electrode exceeds 1 S/m. Our results
show that this can be achieved by including <1wt% single-walled carbon
nanotubes in the electrode.

reliable calculations are highly sought-after. In this paper we compare
diffusion coefficients calculated using nonequilibrium and equilibrium ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations for highly diffusive solid-state
electrolytes for the first time, to demonstrate the accuracy that can be
obtained. Moreover, we show that ab initio nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
can be used to determine diffusion coefficients when the diffusion is too slow
for it to be feasible to obtain them using ab initio equilibrium simulations.
Thereby, using ab initio nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we are
able to obtain accurate estimates of the diffusion coefficients of Li ions in
Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$, two promising electrolytes for
all-solid-state batteries. Furthermore, these calculations show that the
diffusion coefficient of lithium ions in Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$ is higher than many
other potential all-solid-state electrolytes, making it promising for future
technologies. The reasons for variation in conductivities determined using
computational and experimental methods are also discussed. It is demonstrated
that small degrees of disorder and vacancies can result in orders of magnitude
differences in diffusivities of Li ions in Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, and these factors
are likely to contribute to inconsistencies observed in experimentally reported
values. Notably, the introduction of Li-vacancies and disorder can enhance the
ionic conductivity of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl.

storage, and molybdenum doped LiNbO$_3$ (LN:Mo) is an excellent candidate for
holographic data storage. In this paper, the basic features of Mo doped
LiNbO$_3$, such as the site preference, electronic structure, and the lattice
distortions, have been explored from first-principles calculations. Mo
substituting Nb with its highest charge state of +6 is found to be the most
stable point defect form. The energy levels formed by Mo with different charge
states are distributed in the band gap, which are responsible for the
absorption in the visible region. The transition of Mo in different charge
states implies molybdenum can serve as a photorefractive center in LN:Mo. In
addition, the interactions between Mo and intrinsic or extrinsic point defects
are also investigated in this work. Intrinsic defects $\tt V_{Li}^-$ could
cause the movement of the $\tt Mo_{Nb}^+$ energy levels. The exploration of Mo,
Mg co-doped LiNbO$_3$ reveals that although Mg ion could not shift the energy
level of Mo, it can change the distribution of electrons in Mo and Mg co-doped
LN (LN:Mo,Mg) which help with the photorefractive phenomenon.

by its low intrinsic electronic conductivity. Introducing oxygen vacancies can
be one method to overcome this drawback, possibly by altering the charge

  simulations","  Dendrite formation is a major obstacle, such as capacity loss and short
circuit, to the next-generation high-energy-density lithium (Li) metal
batteries. The development of successful Li dendrite mitigation strategies is
impeded by an insufficient understanding of Li dendrite growth mechanisms.
Li-plating-induced internal stress in Li metal and its effect on dendrite
growth have been studied in previous models and experiments, while the
underlying microcosmic mechanism is elusive. Here, we analyze the role of
plating-induced stress in dendrite formation through first-principles
calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the
deposited Li forms a stable atomic nanofilm structure on copper (Cu) substrate.
It is found that the adsorption energy of Li atoms increases from the Li-Cu
interface to deposited Li surface, leading to more aggregated Li atoms at the
interface. Compared to the pristine Li metal, the deposited Li in the early
stage becomes compacted and suffers in-plane compressive stress. Interestingly,
we find that there is a giant strain gradient distribution from the Li-Cu
interface to deposited Li surface, which makes the deposited atoms adjacent to
the Cu surface tend to press upwards with perturbation, causing the dendrite
growth. This understanding provides an insight to the atomic-scale origin of Li
dendrite growth and may be useful for suppressing the Li dendrite in the
Li-metal-based rechargeable batteries.

significance and the preferred extent of variation depend on model assumptions
but the former can be more than four standard deviations, while the latter is
always compatible with constraints at lower redshifts. If Lithium is not

investigate the interactions between AMs such as tungsten dichalcogenides, WX2
(X=S and Se) and the LiPSs. The LiPSs binding behavior of WS2 and WSe2 are
found to be quite similar. The calculated adsorption energies of LiPS species
indicate that the WX2 possesses moderate binding strength and the binding is
facilitated via charge transfer from the polysulfides to the AM. We observe
elongation of intramolecular Li-S bonds in LiPS upon their adsorption onto the
WX2, however, chemical structures of LiPSs are preserved without decomposition.
The calculated density of states indicates the LiPS adsorbed WX2 systems
exhibits semiconducting behavior with a slightly lower bandgap compared to the

finding is that the bulge stars at sub-solar metallicities, and that are older
than about eight billion years, does not show any sign of Li production, that
is, the Li trend with metallicity is flat (or even slightly declining). This
indicates that no lithium was produced during the first few billion years in
the history of the bulge. This finding is essentially identical to what is seen
for the (old) thick disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, and adds another
piece of evidence for a tight connection between the metal-poor bulge and the
Galactic thick disk. For the bulge stars younger than about eight billion
years, the sample contains a group of stars at very high metallicities at
[Fe/H]~+0.4 that have lithium abundances in the range A(Li)=2.6-2.8. In the
Solar neighbourhood the lithium abundances have been found to peak at a
A(Li)~3.3 at [Fe/H]~ +0.1 and then decrease by 0.4-0.5 dex when reaching
[Fe/H]~+0.4. The few bulge stars that we have at these metallicities, seem to
support this declining A(Li) trend. This could indeed support the recent claim
that the low A(Li) abundances at the highest metallicities seen in the Solar
neighbourhood could be due to stars from the inner disk, or the bulge region,
that have migrated to the Solar neighbourhood.

interlayers with low solubility and high nucleation overpotential for lithium
to delay void growth. These interlayers increase dendrite growth tolerance in
solid state electrolytes without the undue necessity for high stack pressures.

quantum enhanced precision measurement and quantum information. To get this
vital continuous variable quantum resource, the generation of squeezed states
of light becomes a key factor. In this paper, a compact telecom fiber-based
bright squeezed light (BSL) generator is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that BSL has been reported in a fiber-based system to date.
To obtain the BSL, a double-pass parametric amplifier based on surface-coated
lithium niobate waveguide is employed. When the 1550 nm seed laser of the
parametric amplifier is blocked, a stable 1.85 dB squeezed vacuum is obtained.
With injected seed power of 80 {\mu}W, an output power of 18 {\mu}W and a
squeezing value of 1.04 dB are achieved of the BSL at 1550 nm. Due to the good
mode matching in the fiber and the absence of the resonant cavity, this
flexible and compact BSL generator has the potential to be useful in
out-of-the-laboratory quantum technologies. Moreover, the BSL has a narrow
spectral width of 30 kHz, which is inherited from a narrow-linewidth
single-frequency seed laser. In addition to being free from the
wavelength-dependent losses, the narrowband BSL is also beneficial to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio of quantum-enhanced precision measurement.

dwarfs that have previously been identified in the field are in fact young
brown dwarf members of nearby young associations. Some of them are still
accreting. They are therefore excellent targets for further studies of the
accretion process in the very low-mass regime at different stages.
  We aim to search for accreting young brown dwarf candidates in a sample of 85
nearby late-M dwarfs.
  Using photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE, we constructed the
spectral energy distribution of the late-M dwarfs based on BT-Settl models to
detect infrared excesses. We then searched for lithium and H$\alpha$ emission
in candidates that exhibit infrared excesses to confirm their youth and the
presence of accretion.
  Among the 85 late-M dwarfs, only DENIS-P J1538317$-$103850 (M5.5) shows
strong infrared excesses in WISE bands. The detection of lithium absorption in
the M5.5 dwarf and its Gaia trigonometric parallax indicate an age of $\sim$1
Myr and a mass of 47 $M_{\rm J}$. The H$\alpha$ emission line in the brown
dwarf shows significant variability that indicates sporadic accretion. This 1
Myr-old brown dwarf also exhibits intense accretion bursts with accretion rates
of up to $10^{-7.9}$$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
  Our detection of sporadic accretion in one of the youngest brown dwarfs might
imply that sporadic accretion at early stages could play an important role in
the formation of brown dwarfs. Very low-mass cores would not be able to accrete
enough material to become stars, and thus they end up as brown dwarfs.

benefit of the PBE0r functional, which relies on on-site Hartree-Fock exchange
only, is a much reduced computational effort that is comparable to GGA
functionals. Furthermore, the Hartree-Fock mixing factors in PBE0r are smaller
than in PBE0, which improves the results for (lithium) manganese oxides. The

Multiple hybrid offshore wind and battery system designs are investigated to
examine the impact of locating the battery offshore versus locating it onshore.
For the examined systems, we explore different battery usable state-of-charge
(SOC) windows, and corresponding dispatch of the battery to maximize energy-
and capacity-market revenues. The impacts of variability of offshore wind
output along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using
publicly available data from 2010 to 2013. Locating the battery onshore
resulted in higher revenues. For 2013, results highlight that without accurate
battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up to
155%, resulting primarily from degradation-related costs. Using advanced
algorithms, net revenue can be increased by 29%. Results also indicate that
wider useable SOC windows could lead to higher net revenues from the energy
market, due to higher arbitrage opportunities that compensate for any
additional degradation-tied costs in higher DODs. The added value of a MWh of
energy storage varies from $2 to $3.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a
breakeven cost range of $50-$95 per kWh for the battery systems studied. As

force-training approach provides substantial improvements over schemes that
train on energies only. Including force information for training reduces the
size of the reference data sets required for ANN potential construction,
increases the transferability of the potential, and generally improves the
force prediction accuracy. For a set of water clusters, the Taylor-expansion
approach achieves around 50% of the force error improvement compared to the
explicit training of all force components, at a much smaller computational
cost. The alternative force training approach thus simplifies the construction
of general ANN potentials for the prediction of accurate energies and
interatomic forces for diverse types of materials, as demonstrated here for
water and a transition-metal oxide.

  potential for fouling resistant oil-water separation","  The surface free energy is one of the most fundamental properties of solids,
hence, manipulating the surface energy and thereby the wetting properties of
solids, has tremendous potential for various physical, chemical, biological as
well as industrial processes. Typically, this is achieved by either chemical
modification or by controlling the hierarchical structures of surfaces. Here we
report a phenomenon whereby the wetting properties of vermiculite laminates are
controlled by the hydrated cations on the surface and in the interlamellar
space. We find that by exploiting this mechanism, vermiculite laminates can be
tuned from superhydrophillic to hydrophobic simply by exchanging the cations;
hydrophilicity decreases with increasing cation hydration free energy, except
for lithium. Lithium, which has a higher hydration free energy than potassium,
is found to provide a superhydrophilic surface due to its anomalous hydrated
structure at the vermiculite surface. Building on these findings, we
demonstrate the potential application of superhydrophilic lithium exchanged
vermiculite as a thin coating layer on microfiltration membranes to resist
fouling, and thus, we address a major challenge for oil-water separation
technology.

generally attributed to the formation of the tetragonal phase (x > 1) due to
overpotentials at the surfaces of the micron-sized particles that are used in
commercial electrodes. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms of
tetragonal phase formation by performing electrochemical lithiation

diffraction and high resolution as well as spectroscopy. We observe a sharp
interface between the cubic spinel (x = 1) and the tetragonal phase (x = 2),
that moves under lithium diffusion-control. The tetragonal phase forms as a
complex nanotwinned microstructure, presumably to relieve the stresses due to
expansion during lithiation. We propose that the twinned microstructure
stabilizes the tetragonal phase, adding to capacity loss upon deep discharge.

produced in the convective envelope of a host star that has engulfed a hot
Jupiter (HJ) companion. We consider solar-metallicity stars in the mass range
of $1.0-2.0~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the Li supplied by a HJ of
$1.0~\mathrm{M_{J}}$. We explore engulfment events that occur near the main
sequence turn-off (MSTO) and out to orbital separations of
$R_{\star}{\sim}~0.1~\mathrm{AU}= 22~\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$. We map our results
onto the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram, revealing the parameter space where
planetary engulfment events produce significant Li enrichment signatures. We
also map the associated survival times of these signatures, which range across
9 orders of magnitude. Our calculations indicate that if the HJ engulfment
event occurs near the MSTO or on the subgiant branch, Li enrichment can be
measured at a $5\sigma$ confidence level and with strengths that exceed
meteoritic abundance measurements. Moreover, for stars of
$1.4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, these signatures are predicted to survive for up to 1

affect lithium (Li) diffusion rate in solid state electrolytes and electrode
materials of LIBs. In this study, we find that strain gradient in bilayer
graphene (BLG) significantly affects Li diffusion barrier, which is termed as
the flexo-diffusion effect, through first-principles calculations. The Li
diffusion barrier substantially decreases/increases under the positive/negative
strain gradient, leading to the change of Li diffusion coefficient in several
orders of magnitude at 300 K. Interestingly, the regulation effect of strain
gradient is much more significant than that of uniform strain field, which can
have a remarkable effect on the rate performance of batteries, with a
considerable increase in the ionic conductivity and a slight change of the
original material structure. Moreover, our ab initio molecular dynamics

provides a driving force for Li diffusion, resulting in oriented diffusion
along the positive strain gradient direction. These findings could extend

density at the pedestal is also associated with both the M-mode and the

modulation happens simultaneously in every Mirnov coil signal where it can be

region are followed by the flattening of the density profile, and by a radially
outward propagating density pulse in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The analysis
of the helium line ratio spectroscopy (He-BES) signals at AUG revealed that the

high resolution optical spectra and measure the equivalent width of the 607.8
nm LiI line for 40 members of the Psc-Eri stream, whose rotational periods have
been derived by arXiv:1905.10588. Results. We show that a tight correlation
exists between lithium content and rotation rate among the late-G to early
K-type stars of the Psc-Eri stream. Fast rotators are systematically Li-rich,
while slow rotators are Li-depleted. This trend mimics the one previously
reported for the similar age Pleiades cluster. Conclusions. The
lithium-rotation connection thus seems to be universal over a restricted
effective temperature range for low-mass stars at or close to the zero-age main
sequence, and does not depend on environmental conditions.

application of near-term quantum computers. A technique introduced in [Higgot
et al., Quantum 3, 156 (2019)], which is named variational quantum deflation
(VQD), has extended the ability of the VQE framework for finding excited states
of a Hamiltonian. However, no method to evaluate transition amplitudes between
the eigenstates found by the VQD without using any costly Hadamard-test-like
circuit has been proposed despite its importance for computing properties of
the system such as oscillator strengths of molecules. Here we propose a method
to evaluate transition amplitudes between the eigenstates obtained by the VQD
avoiding any Hadamard-test-like circuit. Our method relies only on the ability
to estimate overlap between two states, so it does not restrict to the VQD
eigenstates and applies for general situations. To support the significance of
our method, we provide a comprehensive comparison of three previously proposed
methods to find excited states with numerical simulation of three molecules
(lithium hydride, diazene, and azobenzene) in a noiseless situation and find
that the VQD method exhibits the best performance among the three methods.
Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our method by calculating the
oscillator strength of lithium hydride in numerical simulations with shot
noise. Our results illustrate the superiority of the VQD to find excited states
and widen its applicability to various quantum systems.

RGB, lithium should be completely destroyed, but this is not what we observe
today in globular clusters. This element allows to test stellar evolutionary
models, as well as different types of polluters for second population stars in
the multiple population scenarios. Due to the difficulty in the measurement of
the small available lithium line, few GCs have been studied in details so far.

results in designing small-footprint, high-performance optical devices. The

gradients, has played a major role in this success. However, gradient-based
optimization has not yet been applied to the mode-expansion methods that are
the most common approach to studying periodic optical structures like photonic
crystals. This is because, in such simulations, the adjoint variable method
cannot be defined as explicitly as in standard finite-difference or
finite-element time- or frequency-domain methods. Here, we overcome this
through the use of automatic differentiation, which is a generalization of the
adjoint variable method to arbitrary computational graphs. We implement the
plane-wave expansion and the guided-mode expansion methods using an automatic
differentiation library, and show that the gradient of any simulation output
can be computed efficiently and in parallel with respect to all input
parameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a
photonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in
a lithium niobate slab. This extends photonic inverse design to a whole new
class of simulations, and more broadly highlights the importance that automatic

accelerate all species in a quasi-neutral state, providing significant
technological benefits over ion thrusters. Several forms of electromagnetic

potential for both high specific impulse values and high thrust densities.
However, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters are not without drawbacks, and suffer
from cathode erosion issues, among others. A proposed subtype of these
thrusters, known as the Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerator, is thought to
address some of these issues. As is demonstrated in this paper, Lithium Lorentz

encapsulating high-capacity (here: conversion and alloying) electrode materials
have a high potential for use in anode materials for lithium-ion batteries

application in electrochemical energy storage: (1) rigid hollow cavities of the
CNT provide upper limits for nanoparticles in their inner cavities which are
both separated from the fillings of other CNT and protected against
degradation. In particular, the CNT shells resist strong volume changes of
encapsulates in response to electrochemical cycling, which in conventional
conversion and alloying materials hinders application in energy storage
devices. (2) Carbon mantles ensure electrical contact to the active material as
they are unaffected by potential cracks of the encapsulate and form a stable
conductive network in the electrode compound. Our studies confirm that
encapsulates are electrochemically active and can achieve full theoretical
reversible capacity. The results imply that encapsulating nanostructures inside

it to a project that uses a new lithium-ion battery. By setting certain control

correlated with battery cycling behavior at high potentials. Using Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the hybrid PBE0 functional, and the (001)

of CEI at higher potentials, are most relevant to capacity fade. Mechanisms
associated with dissolution or oxidation of native Li2CO3 films, which is
removed before the electrolyte is in contact with oxide surfaces, are also
explored.

Using primarily theoretical elemental feature descriptors derivable from

Carbon is slightly under abundant relative to normal giants among the super
Li-rich giants where the Li abundance exceeds A(Li) = 3.2. The C abundance as
well as the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios from the literature suggest that addition
of Li to create a Li-rich giant may occur independently of the abundance
changes wrought by the first dredge-up. Creation of a super Li-rich giant,

  photon detectors","  Lithium niobate photonic chip could realize diverse optical engineering for
various applications benefiting from its excellent optical performances. In
this letter, we demonstrate monolithic photonic chips for multi-channel
sum-frequency conversion based on reverse-proton-exchange periodically poled
lithium niobate waveguides, with the different channels showing uniform and
excellent conversion efficiencies. To obtain a robust device and provide a
convenient interface for applications, the integrated chip is fiber coupled
with two fiber arrays. The packaged chip then forms the core of a multi-channel
up conversion single photon detector. In each channel the input signal
interacts with a 1950-nm single frequency pump laser and the sum frequency
output is spectrally filtered and detected by a silicon avalanche photodiode.
Average detection efficiency (DE) of 23.2 % and noise count rate (NCR) of 557
counts per second (cps) are achieved, with a standard deviation of 2.73 % and
48 cps over the 30 channels, as well as optical isolation (OI) between nearby
channels of more than 71 dB, which are excellent for the extensive applications
of monolithic photonic chips in fields including deep space laser
communication, high-rate quantum key distribution and single-photon imaging.

including pump depletion, with pump powers as low as 100 $\mu$W (energies
$0.1$~$\mu$J/pulse) and conversion efficiencies up to 33%. In our simple
configuration, the pump beam is tightly focused into a periodically poled
lithium niobate crystal placed in free space. We also observe a recasting of
the photon number statistics for both the pump and the down-converted beams as
the pump power increases to reach the depleted pump regime. We interpret our
experimental results as a clear signature of the interplay between the pump and
the PDC beams in highly efficient parametric down-conversion sources.

  Electrode Particles of Li-ion Batteries","  Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) of high energy density and light-weight design,
have found wide applications in electronic devices and systems. Degradation
mechanisms that caused by lithiation is a main challenging problem for LIBs
with high capacity electrodes like silicon (Si), which eventually can reduce
the lifetime of batteries. In this paper, a hybrid phase field model (PFM) is
proposed to study the fracture behavior of LIB electrodes. The model considers
the coupling effects between lithium (Li) -ion diffusion process, stress
evolution and crack propagation. Also, the dependency of Elastic properties on
the concentration magnitude of Li-ion is considered. A numerical implementation
based on a MATLAB finite element (FE) code is elaborated. Then, the proposed
hybrid PF approach is applied to a Nanowire (NW) Si electrode particle. It is
shown that the hybrid model shows less tendency to crack growth than the
isotropic model.

  Descriptor System Theory","  This manuscript presents an algorithm for individual Lithium-ion (Li-ion)
battery cell state of charge (SOC) estimation when multiple cells are connected
in parallel, using only terminal voltage and total current measurements. For
battery packs consisting of thousands of cells, it is desirable to estimate
individual SOCs by only monitoring the total current in order to reduce sensing
cost. Mathematically, series connected cells yield dynamics given by ordinary
differential equations under classical full voltage sensing. In contrast,
parallel connected cells are evidently more challenging because the dynamics
are governed by a nonlinear descriptor system, including differential equations
and algebraic equations arising from voltage and current balance across cells.
An observer with linear output error injection is formulated, where the
individual cell SOCs and local currents are locally observable from the total
current and voltage measurements. The asymptotic convergence of differential
and algebraic states is established by considering local Lipschitz continuity
property of system nonlinearities. Simulation results on LiNiMnCoO$_2$/Graphite
(NMC) cells illustrate convergence for SOCs, local currents, and terminal
voltage.

  Lithium-Selenium Batteries: A Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study","  The practical applications of lithium selenium (Li-Se) batteries are impeded
primarily due to the dissolution and migration of higher order polyselenides
(Li2Sen) into the electrolyte (known as shuttle effect) and inactive deposition
of lower order polyselenides. The high electrical conductivity and mechanical
strengths of MXenes make them a suitable candidate to provide adequate
anchoring to prevent polyselenides dissolution and improved electrochemical
performance. Herein, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
understand the binding mechanism of Li2Sen on graphene and surface
functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes. We used graphene as reference material to assess
Li2Sen binding strengths on functionalized Ti3C2X2 (where X = S, O, F, and Cl).
We observed that Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 exhibit superior anchoring behavior
compared to graphene, Ti3C2F2, and Ti3C2Cl2. The calculated Li2Sen adsorption
strength provided by S and O terminated Ti3C2 are stronger than the commonly
used ether-based electrolyte, which is a requisite for effective suppression of
the Li2Sen shuttling. The adsorbed Li2Sen on Ti3C2X2 and graphene retains their
structural integrity without a chemical decomposition. The density of states
(DOS) analysis exhibits that the conductive behavior of the Ti3C2X2 is
preserved even after Li2Sen adsorption, which can stimulate the electrochemical
activity of involved Li2Sen chemistry. Based on our unprecedented results,
Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 are found to exhibit superior anchoring behavior for Li2Sen
adsorption, which can be leveraged for designing effective selenium-based
cathode materials to boost the electrochemical performance of the Li-Se battery
system

  Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization: Case Studies on Diffusion of Oxygen
  and Lithium","  Ion-conducting solid electrolytes are widely used for a variety of purposes.
Therefore, designing highly ion-conductive materials is in strongly demand.
Because of advancement in computers and enhancement of computational codes,
theoretical simulations have become effective tools for investigating the
performance of ion-conductive materials. However, an exhaustive search
conducted by theoretical computations can be prohibitively expensive. Further,
for practical applications, both dynamic conductivity as well as static
stability must be satisfied at the same time. Therefore, we propose a
computational framework that simultaneously optimizes dynamic conductivity and
static stability; this is achieved by combining theoretical calculations and
the Bayesian multi-objective optimization that is based on the Pareto
hyper-volume criterion. Our framework iteratively selects the candidate
material, which maximizes the expected increase in the Pareto hyper-volume
criterion; this is a standard optimality criterion of multi-objective
optimization. Through two case studies on oxygen and lithium diffusions, we
show that ion-conductive materials with high dynamic conductivity and static
stability can be efficiently identified by our framework.

  second harmonic generation","  Second harmonic generation (SHG) with a material of large transparency is an
attractive way of generating coherent light sources at exotic wavelength range
such as VUV, UV and visible light. It is of critical importance to improve
nonlinear conversion efficiency in order to find practical applications in
quantum light source and high resolution nonlinear microscopy, etc. Here an
enhanced SHG with conversion efficiency up to the order of 0.01% at SH
wavelength of 282 nm under 11 GW/cm2 pump power via the excitation of anapole
in lithium niobite (LiNbO3, or LN) nanodisk through the dominating d33
nonlinear coefficient is investigated. The anapole has advantages of strongly
suppressing far-field scattering and well-confined internal field which helps
to boost the nonlinear conversion. Anapoles in LN nanodisk is facilitated by
high index contrast between LN and substrate with properties of near-zero-index
via hyperbolic metamaterial structure design. By tailoring the multi-layers
structure of hyperbolic metamaterials, the anapole excitation wavelength can be
tuned at different wavelengths. It indicates that an enhanced SHG can be
achieved at a wide range of pump light wavelengths via different design of the
epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) hyperbolic metamaterials substrates. The proposed
nanostructure in this work might hold significances for the enhanced
light-matter interactions at the nanoscale such as integrated optics.

calculated electron affinities of the sampled fullerynes are negative, and much

fullerenes. Although fulleranes also exhibit higher chemical stability than
fullerynes, but pentagon or hexagon of the fullerane structures cannot pass

of ions and gases at the nanoscale. On the other hand, they can also be used as

in an electric vehicle (EV), we propose an Adaptive Diagonal Forgetting Factor
Recursive Least Square (ADFF-RLS) for accurate battery parameter estimation.
ADFFRLS includes two new proposals in the existing DFF-RLS; The first is an
excitation tag that changes the behavior of the DFFRLS and the EKF according to
the dynamics of the input data. The second is auto-tuning that automatically
finds the optimal value of RLS forgetting factor based on condition number
(CN). Based on this, we proposed a joint estimation algorithm of ADFF-RLS and
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm,
we used experimental data of hybrid pattern battery cells mixed with dynamic
and static patterns. In addition, we added a current measurement error that
occurs when measuring at EV, and realized data that is closer to actual
environment. This data was applied to two conventional estimation algorithms
(Coulomb counting, Single EKF), two joint estimation algorithms (RLS & EKF,
DFF-RLS & EKF) and ADFF-RLS & EKF. As a result, the proposed algorithm showed
higher SOC and SOH estimation accuracy in various driving patterns and actual
EV driving environment than previous studies.

efficient, room-temperature, voltage-driven nitrogen transport (i.e., nitrogen
magneto-ionics) by electrolyte-gating of a single CoN film (without an
ion-reservoir layer). Nitrogen magneto-ionics in CoN is compared to oxygen
magneto-ionics in Co3O4, both layers showing a nanocrystalline
face-centered-cubic structure and reversible voltage-driven ON-OFF
ferromagnetism. In contrast to oxygen, nitrogen transport occurs uniformly
creating a plane-wave-like migration front, without assistance of diffusion
channels. Nitrogen magneto-ionics requires lower threshold voltages and
exhibits enhanced rates and cyclability. This is due to the lower activation
energy for ion diffusion and the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared
to oxygen. These results are appealing for the use of magneto-ionics in nitride
semiconductor devices, in applications requiring endurance and moderate speeds
of operation, such as brain-inspired computing.

spectroscopy, and optical clocks. Over the past decade, the development of
chip-scale platforms has enabled compact integrated waveguides for
supercontinuum generation. However, there is a critical need for an on-chip
self-referencing system that is adaptive to different pump wavelengths,
requires low pulse energy, and does not require complicated processing. Here,
we demonstrate efficient carrier-envelope offset frequency $f_{\textrm{CEO}}$
stabilization of a modelocked laser with only 107 pJ of pulse energy via
self-referencing in an integrated lithium niobate waveguide. We realize an
$f$-$2f$ interferometer through second-harmonic generation and subsequent
supercontinuum generation in a single dispersion-engineered waveguide with a
stabilization performance equivalent to a conventional off-chip module. The
$f_{\textrm{CEO}}$ beatnote is measured over a pump wavelength range of 70 nm.
We theoretically investigate our system using a single nonlinear envelope
equation with contributions from both second- and third-order nonlinearities.
Our modeling reveals rich ultrabroadband nonlinear dynamics and confirms that
the initial second harmonic generation followed by supercontinuum generation
with the remaining pump is responsible for the generation of a strong
$f_{\textrm{CEO}}$ signal as compared to a traditional $f$-$2f$ interferometer.
Our technology provides a highly-simplified system that is robust, low cost,
